IN completing the last contribution I
shall make to the Biographical
Catalogues of the Portrait Galleries
of four English noblemen, I
must make a few personal remarks. I began the
pleasant task, which I undertook at the request
of my dear cousin, Lord Sandwich, now many
years ago, before my defective sight rendered
the work difficult. The respective collections
of Lords Bath and Cowper at Longleat and
Panshanger next occupied my attention, but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_x'>x</span>the increasing malady in my eyesight rendered
every fresh step more arduous. In this last work,
to other stumbling-blocks has been added the
pressure of ill-health and deep sorrow; against
these obstacles I have fought as stoutly as I
could, cheered on by the hope of giving satisfaction
to Lord and Lady Bradford, to whose family
my own for many generations has been connected
by ties of relationship and friendship.
But I am well aware that in spite of my best
endeavours errors may have crept into this
work, and shortcomings must be but too evident.
On the indulgence of the owners of Weston,
I must, therefore, rely for pardon; proffering at
the same time my best thanks to Lord Bradford
himself for the kind help he has afforded me;
while to Mr. George Griffiths of Weston Bank
I can scarcely say enough to express my gratitude
for his unwearied and valuable assistance.
I wish that, in relinquishing a task in which I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xi'>xi</span>have found great delight, I could persuade some
members of noble and gentle families to follow
my example in rescuing from oblivion the records
of portraits which adorn the walls of their homes.
It has often been a subject of deep concern to
me, while staying in some beautiful country-house,
to find that the younger portion of the family, at
least, were often entirely ignorant of any details
respecting the lives of the men and women who
look down upon them from the walls, and who in
some cases have lived, loved, enjoyed, suffered,
and died in those very apartments. To the dear
old traditions of home such acquaintance with
our predecessors and their surroundings lends
many a charm, and I have found so much
pleasure in my work that I cannot but regret my
inability to the further prosecution thereof; but
I have reaped a rich reward in the acquaintance
I have made with particulars of the lives of
the great, the good, and the celebrated; and as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xii'>xii</span>I wander through a portrait-gallery, the paintings
of which are, alas! now but a closed
book to me, the names which my more fortunate
companions read aloud conjure up a whole host
of delightful and interesting recollections.</p>

SHE was the second daughter of Thomas,
last Earl of Southampton, of the Wriothesley
family, by his first wife, Rachel de
Ruvigny, of an old Huguenot race, by
whom he had two daughters, Elizabeth
married to Edward, Lord Noel, eldest son
of the Earl Campden, and Rachel, the subject of the present
notice. She lost her mother when still a little child, and we
do not hear much of her youth. Her father married a second
and a third time, and it must have been about 1653 that she
became the bride of Lord Vaughan, son of the Earl of
Carbery. We are inclined to deduce from a passage in
one of her letters that this marriage was one of <i>convenance</i>,
as she says to a friend, ‘The selection of the partners usually
rests with the relations, and not with those most interested in
the matter.’ Of Lord Vaughan we have few records; but
some letters addressed to his wife leave the impression that
indolence was one of his chief characteristics, that he was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>dilatory in business and averse to writing of all kinds. It is
fair, however, to add that these remarks are only based on
surmise.</p>

<p class='c016'>Lord and Lady Vaughan resided chiefly at an estate in
Wales, belonging to Lord Carbery, and at the present time
(1888) the property of the Earl of Cawdor. The Golden
Grove is famed for its picturesque beauty, and endeared to all
admirers of Jeremy Taylor, by the tradition that he composed
<i>The Whole Duty of Man</i> in the grounds adjoining the house.
Lord and Lady Vaughan made occasional visits to London,
where in 1665 she gave birth to a daughter, who only lived a
few days. The breaking out of the plague drove them back
to their Welsh home, and Lord Vaughan died not long after
their return. On becoming a widow, Rachel went to reside
for some time with her sister, Lady Elizabeth Noel, at their
old home of Titchfield, in Hampshire, which had come by
inheritance to Lady Elizabeth, as the eldest daughter of Lord
Southampton,—Stratton, in the same county, falling to Lady
Vaughan’s share. It was not long before (among many
admirers) that William Russell, the second son of Francis,
fifth Earl (afterwards first Duke) of Bedford, made himself
conspicuous by the devoted court he paid to the beautiful
young widow. The circumstance is thus alluded to, in a letter
from her sister by half-blood, Lady Percy: ‘For Mr. Russell’s
concern I can say nothing more than that he professes a
great desire (the which I do not at all doubt) that he and
every one else has to gain one who is so desirable in all
respects.’</p>

<p class='c016'>Desirable indeed, for Lady Vaughan was young, beautiful,
intellectual, wealthy, of a most gentle and loving disposition,
and possessing a fund of unassuming piety. There was no
disparity in the marriage, for William Russell was her equal,
we might almost say her counterpart, with the exception of
fortune, he being a second son at the time of his marriage.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>It was on this account that his wife for some time, in fact
until the death of her brother-in-law, Lord Russell, still
retained, according to general custom, her widowed title of
Lady Vaughan. During the fourteen happy years of Rachel’s
happy life, which were chiefly spent at Stratton, and Southampton
House in London (both of which were hers by inheritance),
she had to endure very few separations from her
husband—such as when he was called away on public or
private business; occasional visits to his father at Woburn;
absences contingent on his elections in three different Parliaments,
and attendance during the short session at Oxford.
Then the correspondence between the married pair was constant
and detailed, and testifies to their sympathy on every
subject, whether important or trifling, political or domestic.
Happy as she was in the present, with every human probability
of the continuance of that happiness in the future, there was
a strange foreboding, as it would appear, in Rachel’s mind,
of coming evil, and it was remarkable how in those early
halcyon days her mental eyes seemed fixed on the little cloud,
no bigger than a man’s hand, in the horizon. It was indeed
as if she heard ‘the footfall of fate on her ear’; for her
letters to her husband, not very long after their marriage, are
written in a most desponding spirit. After dwelling with
gratitude and delight on the complete unity of their hearts
and minds, she goes on to write to her dearest William, dated
from Stratton: ‘Let us cheerfully expect to live together to
a good old age, and, if God wills otherwise, then firmly
believe that He will support us under whatsoever trial He
may see fit to inflict.’ Noble and pathetic words, of which
the sadder alternative was to be her allotted portion. The
summer was usually passed at Stratton, the winter in London.
Three children were born to them—two daughters, in 1674
and 1676, and a son in 1680,—blessings which were counterbalanced
by the loss of her beloved sister, Lady Elizabeth
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>Noel. The society of the children enhanced the delight of
their beloved home at Stratton. On one occasion Rachel
wrote to her husband at the last-mentioned place from Southampton
House in answer to a letter from him. She is so
glad he finds Stratton sweet, and hopes he will live for fifty
years to enjoy it, and that God may permit her to have his
good company. But if it were not so, she is sure he would be
kind to ‘the brats.’ Flesh and blood cannot have a truer
sense of happiness than she has, his poor honest wife. Such
simple extracts are truly pathetic, when we call to mind that
in less than two years Rachel Russell was a widow. The
circumstances of Lord Russell’s arrest, his impeachment for
high treason, his trial, sentence, last days, and execution, with
the part his devoted wife took in all these proceedings, are
all given in our notice of Lord Russell’s life. In order to avoid
repetition we simply give the dates here. William, Lord
Russell, was tried on the 13th of July 1683, and executed the
21st August.</p>

<p class='c016'>After the last sad scene of leave-taking, elsewhere described,
Rachel returned to her desolate home of Southampton
House. On the anguish of such moments it is useless to
dwell. She heard the hours from the neighbouring belfry,
which sounded like a chime of knells, as she sat in perfect
solitude—the little ones having cried themselves to sleep.
Her favourite sister, Elizabeth, was dead; her surviving sister,
Lady Northumberland, was out of England, and there was no
one near enough her heart whose society she could tolerate at
that supreme moment. Her grief was embittered and her
indignation roused, not long after her lord’s death, by the
report that was circulated calling in question the authenticity
of the papers which he had given to the sheriffs on the
scaffold. She found it incumbent on her to write to the King,
speaking in the highest terms in her letter of Bishop Burnet,
who had lately fallen into disfavour at Court. Burnet had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>been privy to the document written by Lord Russell in prison,
and Rachel characterises the prelate as a loyal subject to the
King, and the most tender and faithful minister to her dear
lord. One of the last injunctions laid upon her (by one
whose wishes were never disobeyed), was that she should take
care of her health, and live for her children; and in the fulfilment
of that duty she found her best consolation. In a
letter to the Bishop of London, she says that she considered
there was something so sublime in the subject of her deepest
sorrow, she firmly believes it had in a degree kept her from
being overwhelmed. And now began the long dreary period
of widowhood which lasted so many years. ‘Time, that
ancient nurse,’ which ‘rocks us to patience,’ found her indeed
submissive, but had little power to deaden the poignancy of
her grief. In a letter to ‘uncle John’ (her lord’s uncle), she
begs him to make some compliment of her acknowledgment
to his Majesty for not having enforced the forfeiture of Lord
Russell’s fortune. She concludes by saying: ‘When I hear
you are well it is part of the only satisfaction I can have in
this wretched world, where the love and company of the
friends and relations of that dear blessed person are most
precious.’</p>

<p class='c016'>Among Lady Russell’s most frequent and most intimate
correspondents was Dr. Fitzwilliam, the friend of her childhood,
who had been her father’s domestic chaplain. She also
continued her intercourse with Bishop Burnet, and tells him
how diligently she superintends the education of her children,
Mistress Rachel, little Mistress Katey, and that precious
boy with whose wild freaks in happier days she was wont
to entertain papa. She confesses to the Bishop that she
occasionally finds the employment of teaching irksome to her
overtaxed spirit; yet on the whole it refreshes her, and she is
resolved to prosecute the task alone and unassisted. This
plan the Bishop highly approves, and he alludes to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>circumstance in these words: ‘I am glad your children will
need no other governess, for as it is the greatest part of your
duty, so the occupation will be a noble entertainment, and the
best diversion and cure for your wasted and wearied spirit.’
It is to Bishop Burnet that she describes her sensations on
visiting her husband’s tomb at Chenies: ‘I did not go to seek
the living among the dead, for I well knew that I should see
him no more, wherever I went, and I had made a covenant
with myself not to break out into unreasonable and fruitless
passion, but quicken my contemplation of his happiness.’</p>

<p class='c016'>There are two classes of mourners most prevalent in the
world, those who give way to enervating emotion, nursing and
encouraging the outward expression of grief, and those who fly
to some frivolous and unworthy expedient to ‘lull the lone
heart and banish care.’ To neither of these classes did Lady
Russell belong; she faced her affliction bravely but submissively,
believing with the poet<a id='r1' /><a href='#f1' class='c017'><sup>[1]</sup></a> that</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c018'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘They who lack time to mourn, lack time to mend.</div>
      <div class='line in14'>Eternity mourns that.’</div>

<p class='c020'><span class='label'><a href='#r1'>1</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Philip van Artevelde.</p>
</div>

<p class='c016'>She spent a great deal of her time at Woburn, with her
parents-in-law, where she and her children were ever welcome;
often meditating, and frequently delaying her return to the
once happy home of sweet Stratton. But she was detained at
Woburn first by the death of her mother-in-law, and then by
the dangerous illness of her son, which crushing anxiety she
thus turns to good account. Speaking of the possibility of
losing ‘the little creature,’ she writes to Dr. Fitzwilliam,
‘God has made me see the folly of imagining I had nothing
left, the deprivation of which could be matter of much anguish,
or its possession of any considerable refreshment.’ But the
blow was averted and the boy recovered. She left Woburn, and
instead of going direct to Stratton she started for Totteridge
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>in Hertfordshire, with him and her eldest girl, while little
Katey was left at Woburn to keep company with her aged
grandfather.</p>

<p class='c016'>No one was more alive to the noble and loveable qualities
of Lady Russell than her dear lord’s father, and he writes her
a most tender and pathetic letter, evincing the deepest interest
in her and her children, especially in the recovery of the
young heir, whose illness had caused so much anxiety to the
whole family. He addresses her as his dearest daughter, and
expresses himself in the quaint and courteous, though somewhat
stilted style of the day, hoping soon to have some comfortable
tidings of her and her dear little ones, assuring her
that his grandson is the subject of his constant prayers, and
that while he has breath he remains her affectionate father
and friend to command. Written from Woburn Abbey, the
7th day of June 1684; with a postscript: ‘My dear love and
blessing to my dear boy, and to Mistress Rachel. I am much
cheered by Mistress Catherine’s company; she is often with me,
and looks very well.’ It is interesting to remember that the
respective ages of these two playfellows were nine, and eighty.</p>

<p class='c016'>Lady Russell moved afterwards with her family to Southampton
House, so full of memories, sweet and bitter, of early
happiness, subsequent anxiety, and utter desolation. She was
in London at the time of the King’s death, and although she
had no reason to regret Charles, yet to one whose interest was
never deadened in the course of public affairs, there was little
to be hoped for in the accession of James the Second. The
trials of Algernon Sidney, Hampden, and others, who were
associated with the memory of her lord, made her wounds
bleed afresh, more especially the execution of the Duke of
Monmouth, Lord Russell’s most intimate friend. ‘Never,’ she
writes, ‘had a poor creature more <i>awakers</i> to quicken and
revive her sorrow’; yet in alluding to Monmouth’s fate she
owns herself void of reason, that she should weep when she
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>ought to rejoice ‘that so good a man is safely landed on the
blessed shores of a safe eternity.’ She was detained in London
longer than she wished by the arrival of her uncle the Marquis
de Ruvigny, who had come over from France to assist in the
endeavour to gain from the King and Government the subversion
of the attainder which affected the Russell children.
Very interesting letters and documents on this subject are
extant at Woburn Abbey. Lady Russell was very much
attached to her uncle, and welcomed him, his wife, and a
favourite niece, to her house, where the last-mentioned relative
fell sick of malignant fever and died, to the inexpressible grief
of De Ruvigny. Rachel’s anxiety on account of her own
children may be imagined; she removed them to the country,
and then returned to London to comfort her sorrowing uncle.
De Ruvigny later on resided permanently in England, and
became the centre of a small colony of French refugees which
settled at Greenwich, and he ended his days in this country.
The Earl of Devonshire, the faithful friend (when Lord Cavendish)
of William Russell, who had offered to change clothes
with him and remain in his stead in prison, had never
slackened in his friendship for his friend’s widow; and he now
came forward with a proposal of marriage between his eldest
son and Rachel’s eldest daughter and namesake.</p>

<p class='c016'>In those days no time was lost in such matters. My Lord
Cavendish was sixteen, Mistress Rachel fourteen. There were
difficulties about settlements (<i>car l’histoire se répète</i>) among
the lawyers, but the marriage did come off at last in spite of
those everlasting impediments to the course of true love.
Deeply interested as she was in domestic details and in arrangements
for the future of her child, Lady Russell was no
indifferent spectator to the rapid strides which James the
Second was making towards the downfall of political and
religious liberty which he was too short-sighted to foresee
would include his own. When M. Dykeveldt, the minister
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>plenipotentiary from Holland, arrived in London, he waited
on Lady Russell by the commands of the Prince and Princess
of Orange, being the bearer of autograph letters and the most
flattering messages from their Highnesses, speaking in terms
of the highest admiration and esteem of her patriot lord and
the noble family to which he belonged, and assuring her of
friendship and sympathy and the hope that they might in the
future be useful to her and her son. Thus commenced a
correspondence which brought forth important fruits in the
coming changes. Her first visit to Stratton was very trying to
her heart, and though grateful that the children were too young
to share those feelings to any great extent, she could not but
rejoice to perceive in Mistress Rachel some memory of the
loss they had sustained, but then to be sure, as the reader will
take into consideration, Rachel Russell the younger was
already fourteen years of age and a promised wife! Three
days the poor widow always gave to seclusion and reflection,
the anniversaries of the arrest, trial, and execution of her lord.
In the winter the family removed to London, and preparations
were now going on briskly for the marriage, when the poor
<i>fiancée</i> fell sick of the measles, and it was not till midsummer
1689 that the celebration of the marriage actually took place,
being hurried at the last, we are told, because my Lord
(Devonshire, the bridegroom’s father) was in haste to go to
the Bath.</p>

<p class='c016'>The young couple spent their (crescent) honeymoon between
Southampton House and Woburn Abbey, and then the bridegroom
set forth on a course of foreign travel to finish his
education which lasted two years, while my Lady Cavendish
remained an inmate of her mother’s home. The leading
members of the houses of Cavendish and Russell were among
those influential personages who had invited the Prince and
Princess of Orange to come over to England to the rescue of
the kingdom; and when they actually landed Rachel put herself
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>in constant communication with her old friend Bishop
Burnet, at that time in the suite of the future monarchs. She
accompanied her aged father-in-law to London, in time to
witness the flight of James the Second, and there is extant an
amusing letter from young Lady Cavendish in which she
describes to a bosom friend, the decision of the two Houses of
Parliament that William and Mary of Orange should be King
and Queen. She goes on to say she was present at the
proclamation, which gave her great pleasure, ‘for were they
not in the room of King James, my father’s murderer?’ At
night she went to Court to kiss the Queen’s hand, the King’s
also, with her mother-in-law, the Countess of Devonshire. She
describes William ‘as a man of no presence; he is homely at
first sight, but when one looks long on him he has something
both wise and good.’ The Queen she considers very handsome,
and most graceful.</p>

<p class='c016'>One of the first acts of the new King and Queen was the
reversal of the attainder of William, Lord Russell; his execution
had already been declared to be a murder by the vote
of the House of Commons. Honours of different kinds were
showered on the aged Earl of Bedford, the Earl of Devonshire,
and many of Lady Russell’s connections and friends, while she
herself was constantly referred to for advice and counsel by
people whom she held in great esteem, such as Dr. Fitzwilliam
and Archbishop Tillotson, who discussed with her questions
of doctrine and faith, and the propriety or expediency of
accepting preferment under the new <i>régime</i>. People of all
opinions applied to Rachel to secure her good offices with the
new Sovereigns, and Lady Sunderland, whose husband had
been most instrumental in Lord Russell’s downfall, did not
scruple to ask her intercession. Passing years brought fresh
trials in their train for one who seemed indeed born for
sorrow. In 1690 she lost her remaining sister, the wife of
Ralph, Lord afterwards Duke of Montagu, and within a few
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>weeks of her death she mourns that of her nephew Lord
Gainsborough, ‘that engaging creature,’ she writes, ‘the only
son of the sister whom I loved with so much passion,’ and now as
a crowning grief she is threatened with blindness. It had been
said that this infirmity proceeded from her constant weeping;
and though one of her biographers argues that it was impossible
on account of the particular nature of the disease, being
cataract, those who unfortunately have experience in such
cases know well how noxious to the sight is the briny nature
of sorrow’s flood. It is piteous to read her sad anticipations
of the coming evil, and how she will have to forego that great
relaxation and comfort to her, of what she terms ‘society at a
distance. But while light is left her she will work.’</p>

<p class='c016'>Lord Cavendish having now returned from the Continent
was joined by his young wife, and there was a sad gap when
dearest Rachel left her home. The fond mother writes to
Lady Derby, Mistress of the Robes to Queen Mary, recommending
her daughter, who was much at Court, to that lady’s
kind protection; and now yet another of the young birds was
called on to leave the nest. Mistress Kate was asked in
marriage by Lord Roos, eldest son of the Earl of Rutland,
esteemed the best match in all England. Yet there were
reasons of a political and domestic nature which caused Lady
Russell to hesitate before giving her final consent to the
marriage. There is an amusing description of the grand
reception which the newly married pair met with at the
paternal estate of Belvoir, falling very little short of the pomp
and splendour due to royalty on such occasions. We regret that
our want of space precludes the introduction of some interesting
details. Rachel did not go to the marriage, for noise and
too much company made her eyes ache, and she was desirous
to keep ‘the little bit of sight she had left,’ which deserted her
as soon as a candle was lighted. There was still balm in
Gilead. The operation for couching was successfully performed,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>and the patient, after making use of an amanuensis for some
time, was able once more to resume her correspondence and
enjoy ‘society at a distance.’ Following this inestimable
blessing came the mark of royal favour which must have been
a source of intense gratification to Rachel, Lady Russell.
Her son-in-law and her father-in-law were both advanced to
the rank of Dukes of Devonshire and Bedford. And in the
case of the latter, the honour was enhanced to the old man,
Lady Russell, and the whole family, by the tribute paid in the
words of the patent to the memory of his patriot son. Sure
never was sentiment so mingled before or since with legal and
formal documents, but the words (or preamble as it is called)
were those of the eloquent and refined Lord Chancellor
Somers. The King in bestowing the highest dignity in his gift
declares, ‘We think it not sufficient that his (Lord Russell’s)
conduct and virtues should be transmitted to all future generations
upon the credit of public annals, but will have them
inserted in these our royal letters-patent as a monument consecrated
to the most accomplished and consummate virtue,’
etc. etc. All honour to the house whose patent of nobility
well deserves the name!</p>

<p class='c016'>A general election was now impending, and Lady Russell
received the most flattering proposals from the leading
members of the Government, that her son should represent
Middlesex in the House of Commons. She makes a very
gracious answer, and after taking counsel with the aged Duke,
she writes they have both come to the conclusion that a
Parliament life would interfere with the progress of Lord Tavistock’s
education, he being only fifteen. Strange times when
schoolboys married and sat in Parliament! The young heir
went to Oxford (instead of to the House), where he was more
than once visited by his mother.</p>

<p class='c016'>When about seventeen Lord Tavistock started with a
private tutor on a continental tour, which lasted over two
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>years, and which the young man enjoyed perhaps a little too
much. He made his mother a confidante of all his pleasures,
extravagancies, and escapades, for Tavistock was one of those
who loved the beautiful, whether in sights, sounds, or people.
He had also grand notions of the style in which the heir to
an English dukedom should live—must have a carriage with
a fine pair of steppers and two running footmen; his cravats
must be of rich point lace, and his suits finely embroidered.
Moreover he found himself constrained to send all the way
from Rome to Leghorn to procure a periwig, as the world’s
capital could not furnish him with one to his taste. Then
there were flowers and gifts of jewels to please the fair
Romans, and added to all these ways and means of getting
rid of his pocket-money, our traveller had a decided inclination
for gambling. His letters are the natural outpourings of
an enthusiastic youth in the heyday of spirits and enjoyment,
rather too easily led astray, and although they caused his
mother some distress, they contained nothing likely to
diminish her esteem for her only son. He confessed his
delinquencies so frankly, solicited help so humbly, and begged
his beloved mother’s pardon, and her intercession for that of
his grandfather, in a most irresistible manner.</p>

<p class='c016'>Within a year after Lord Tavistock’s return to England,
he succeeded to his grandfather’s titles and estates on the
death of that good old man, and in compliance with personal
request made by his mother, the King bestowed on him the
Garter, and shortly afterwards he was appointed Lord-Lieutenant
of the three counties of Bedford, Middlesex, and Cambridge,
while at the Coronation of Queen Anne he acted as
Lord High Constable of England, and was made a Privy
Councillor. He had married in 1669 the daughter of John
Howland, Esquire, who was created Lord Howland of Streatham,
in order to obviate any appearance of a <i>mésalliance</i>.
But all this prosperity was of short duration; eleven years
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>after his accession to the title, at the early age of thirty-one,
Wriothesley, the second Duke of Bedford, fell a victim to the
terrible disease, which in those days (before inoculation or
vaccination was known) wrought such ravages in England.
When the character of the illness was announced, the
Duchess and his children were sent to a distance, but
the fond mother watched by his bedside to the last,
and writes, after all is over, to her cousin Lord Galway:
‘I am in such disorder of spirits, so full of confusion, and
amazement, that I am incapable of saying or doing what I
should. I did not know the greatness of my love for his
person, till I could see it no more.’ The poor mourner had
scarcely time to lift her head, bowed by the combined weight
of age and sorrow, before another crushing blow fell on her.
Her sweet Katey (now Duchess of Rutland) died in giving
birth to her tenth child, at the same moment that the Duchess
of Devonshire was expecting her confinement. From her
Lady Russell had the arduous task of concealing the fact of
the other’s death. The two sisters had loved each other
tenderly, and there was great difficulty in evading the
inquiries which the Duchess constantly made after her dear
Katey. ‘I saw her yesterday,’ was the sad subterfuge, ‘out
of her bed.’ Alas! it was in her coffin.</p>

<p class='c016'>The Duke of Rutland was not slow in providing himself
with a second wife, and this unseemly haste was not calculated
to soothe Lady Russell’s mind, but when she found that his
intentions with regard to her daughter’s children were just
and generous, she thought it advisable ‘to let the matter pass
easily.’ She had now arrived at an advanced age, somewhat
infirm in body, but unimpaired in mind, with a trembling
hand, but an unclouded intellect, and she busied herself in
composing prayers and meditations for her own use, and in
making, as it were, a full confession of her failings and shortcomings
(which she called sins); reviewing as she did so the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>whole of her past life. This document was left unfinished at
the time of her death. When at the age of eighty-six, her
health gave way.</p>

<p class='c016'>A letter from Lady Rachel Morgan (wife of Sir William
Morgan of Tredegar) to her brother, Lord James Cavendish,
says: ‘The bad account we have received of Grandmamma
Russell has put us into great disorder and hurry. Mamma has
left us and gone to London. I believe she has stopped the
letters, so we are still in suspense; the last post brought us so
bad an account that we have reason to fear the worst. I hope
mamma will get to town in time to see her alive, because it
would be a great satisfaction to both.’ This letter is dated
26th September. On the 29th of the same month 1723,
Rachel, Lady Russell, ended her exemplary and blameless
life, so replete with stirring incidents, both of a public and
private nature, so full of transient joy and abiding sorrow. She
lived to see her children raised to honour and prosperity, but,
alas! she had the misfortune to survive those who, in the
common course of nature, should have wept her loss. She was
buried by the side of her dear lord at Chenies, in Buckinghamshire,
where an elaborate monument is erected to their
memory.</p>

BORN at Delft, the son of John de Groot
(Dutch for ‘Great’), of an ancient family,
Burgomaster of the town, and Curator of
the recently founded University of Leyden,
which was destined to become so famous.
Hugo was one day totally to eclipse the
fame of his father, though he too was a man of great learning
and cultivation. Hugo was remarkable for his proficiency
in Latin and Greek when a mere child, and, unlike most
precocious geniuses, he fulfilled his early promise. He was
placed with an Arminian minister at the Hague, and when
only eight years old, composed some Latin verses, which are
still extant. At the age of eleven he was entered as a student at
Leyden, and became the pet (so to speak) of a circle of learned
professors, of whom he was destined to become the foremost.
In those early days Hugo distinguished himself in every
branch of learning, addressed a Greek ode to the Prince of
Orange, which gained him great κυδος, as did shortly afterwards
a Latin poem in honour of Henry the Fourth of France.</p>

<p class='c016'>In 1598 Hugo accompanied Count Justin of Nassau (natural
son of William the Silent) and John Olden Barneveldt on a
diplomatic mission to Paris. Henry the Fourth, remembering
the tribute paid him by the young foreigner, showed him
especial favour, presented him with his picture and a chain of
massive gold, and pointed him out to the courtiers as ‘a
miracle of learning, and the wonder of Holland.’ The young
Prince of Condé also took great delight in his society, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>called him his secretary. To this youthful patron Grotius
dedicated his first printed work, <i>Martianus Capella</i>.</p>

<p class='c016'>Hugo remained in Paris for about a year, when a summons
from his parents called him home. On his return he took up
his abode at the house of Prince Maurice of Nassau’s chaplain,
a learned and pious man, where he studied law without
neglecting his literary labours. He pleaded his first cause at
Delft when only seventeen, gaining thereby the greatest
applause. He published works on astronomy, physics, navigation,
both in dead and living languages, and his description
of the siege of Ostend (which place had held out three years
against the Spaniards) was considered a masterpiece. His
writings on contemporary history, in which he did full justice
to the noble and patriotic deeds of his countrymen, also called
especial attention to the merits of the young author, and the
Government were easily induced to listen to the recommendation
of Olden Barneveldt, and in due time Hugo Grotius was
selected as historiographer, and this in preference to many
candidates, all of whom were his seniors, while the salary was
increased in consideration of the nominee’s acknowledged
talents. The French King wished to secure him as President
of the Library at Paris, and the star of Grotius was now in the
ascendant. He was named to the post of Pensionary of the
city of Rotterdam, vacant by the death of Elias, brother to
Olden Barneveldt, with whom Grotius now contracted an
intimate friendship. This office, together with other privileges,
entitled the holder to a seat in the Assembly of the States of
Holland, and afterwards to the same honour in that of the
States-General. On this promotion, Grotius’s father was
desirous that his son should marry, and an alliance was
accordingly agreed on with Maria von Reigensberg, a lady of
noble family in Zeeland, the daughter of a Burgomaster of
Veer, in that province. The bride, it would seem, was by no
means comely in appearance; she was stoutly built and of a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>swarthy complexion, but the future proved Maria von Grotius
to be a woman of strong affection, acute intelligence, and
indomitable courage. Shortly after his arrival in Rotterdam,
Grotius was sent to England on a mission connected with
some dispute which had arisen between the Dutch and
English, connected with the whale fisheries, and here he was
cordially welcomed by James the First, with whom he had
many conferences, on matters theological, as well as diplomatic,
while his society was eagerly courted by all the men of
eminence in this country. But a storm was gathering over the
calm horizon of Hugo Grotius’s hitherto bright career. On
his return to Rotterdam he found that the religious differences
which had been gradually waxing hotter and hotter throughout
the United Provinces had now assumed a most formidable
aspect. The whole country was divided into two separate
factions of the Arminians and the Gomarites; the former
party strongly opposing, and the latter strenuous upholding,
the doctrines of Calvin. After some wavering, or perhaps we
had better say investigation, of the subject, Grotius decided
on embracing the tenets of Arminius. Remonstrances and
counter-remonstrances were brought forward by the two
parties, Synods were convened, public disturbances ensued,
and the disputes which had commenced in a question of
dogma developed into political animosity. A decree was
issued by the States, with a view to putting down the serious
riots which had lately occurred, and extraordinary powers were
granted to magisterial bodies, a measure which, combined with
others equally obnoxious to him, gave great offence to Maurice
of Nassau, the Stadtholder, and he was violently incensed
against the men at whose instigation the step had been taken.
Between the prince and the friend of his youth, John Olden
Barneveldt, great differences of opinion had for some time
existed, and it was in the year 1619 that this venerable patriot
and his friend Grotius were both thrown into prison—whence
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>the former, after a summary and unjust trial, only came out on
his way to the scaffold. In that solemn moment Barneveldt
showed great solicitude as to the fate of his friend, and
learning in answer to his question that Grotius did not lie
under sentence of death, he exclaimed, ‘I greatly rejoice, for
he is young, and will, I firmly trust, live long to be of service
to his country.’ The trial of Grotius followed, and accusations
as groundless as those which had been brought forward against
the grand Pensionary were laid to his charge, including treason
to his country, complicity with Spain, etc. etc., and he was
sentenced to imprisonment for life and the confiscation of his
entire property. He was conveyed from one prison to another,
until the castle of Loevenstein, near Gorcum in South Holland,
was chosen for his final resting-place. This gloomy old
fortress was considered impregnable, and the most stringent
measures were taken against escape; indeed the internal
arrangements of the building and its contiguity to the river
seemed to preclude all possibility of evasion. Here Grotius
and his learned friend Hogersbaert were immured, and by dint
of manifold petitions and ‘continual wearying,’ their faithful
wives were allowed to share their captivity. But all intercourse
was forbidden between the two men who were attached
to each other, not only by friendship, but sympathy in literary
pursuits, while the poor ladies were altogether denied the
consolation of each other’s society; and when Hogersbaert’s
wife fell ill, Madame Grotius petitioned in vain for the
privilege (so dear to every gentle-hearted woman) of ministering
to her friend in sickness, or cheering her last moments with
the promise of watching over the dying mother’s six helpless
children. The only proof of sympathy which one captive was
allowed to show the other was in the transmission of a pathetic
epitaph by Hugo Grotius, which was gratefully received by
the unhappy widower.</p>

<p class='c016'>Madame Grotius had contrived to retain a portion of her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>own, when her husband’s property was confiscated, and with
this small sum she endeavoured to make his condition less
intolerable. She rejected with disdain the scanty dole allowed
by Government for the maintenance of the prisoner, and constantly
ferried over to Gorcum, on the opposite side of the
river, to cater for little dainties for her lord, and the noble
dame would stand for hours over the kitchen fire preparing
the daily banquet for him and for their children. Maria was
indeed one of those characters of combined strength and tenderness,
which go near to form ‘the perfect woman.’ When
her husband was first arrested, her anxiety for his life never
betrayed her into weakness or cowardice; on the contrary,
she wrote constantly, urging him to maintain his principles,
and rather die than ask pardon, which could only be obtained
through servile submission. Her admiration for Grotius, and
her pride in his genius, could only be equalled by her affection.
To think that a man, with whose name Europe already
rang, whose writings were fated to influence the destinies of
nations—that he should waste the best days of his life in prison—wither
away, as it were, in a living tomb,—the thought was
intolerable to her. The Commandant of the fortress, one
Deventer, cherished a spite against his noble prisoner, arising
from some family feud which had been handed down from
the last generation, and he took especial delight in riveting
the heavy chains as tightly as he could, and making captivity
unbearable. Air and exercise were seldom vouchsafed, and
Grotius, the philosopher, the metaphysician, the historian, the
world-famed author, might be seen spinning a large top in the
lobby adjoining his apartments for the best exercise he could
get! Even the society of his beloved wife and that of his
children did not suffice to prevent the hours from dragging
heavily along, deprived as he was of the joys of a scholar’s
heart, the books in which he could study the thoughts of
others, the writing materials with which he could record his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>own; therefore Maria never rested until she had wrung
from the authorities the permission to obtain from Grotius’s
own library the volumes most coveted, together with pen, ink,
and paper. Henceforth the captive’s life was no longer a
blank. He devoured his classics, he made notes and translations,
he wrote works on History, Theology, Jurisprudence,
and thus shed a light on the outer world from behind the
walls of his gloomy fortress. But these alleviations were not
sufficient to content the faithful wife; she had more daring
schemes in view. Had she ever heard, or does the Dutch
language, so rich in proverbs, contain an equivalent for our
‘Love laughs at locksmiths’? Certain it is she was destined
to realise the words of a lowly poet of our own days—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c018'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Oh! woman all would do, would dare;</div>
      <div class='line in1'>To save her heart’s best cherished care</div>
      <div class='line in1'>She’d roam the world tract wide,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Nor bolts nor bars can ’gainst her stand,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Or weapons stay her gentle hand,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>When love and duty guide.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c022'>She laid her train most carefully, most skilfully, nor did
she allow any undue haste to mar its fulfilment. She had in
her constant marketings at Gorcum cultivated the acquaintance
and gained the friendship of many of the bettermost
tradespeople of the town, and her maid Lieschen, who was
market-woman in turn, was instructed to do the same. They
both talked constantly to the good burghers’ wives, and interested
them in behalf of the captive, the great writer and
philosopher, and, what came nearer the women’s hearts, the
tender husband and father. The plot was ripening in the
devoted conspirator’s mind; but there came a moment of
suspicion and alarm; it was reported that Madame Grotius
had bought a coil of ropes in Gorcum, doubtless to facilitate
her husband’s escape. An inquiry was instituted, when the
suspected lady herself pointed out to the emissaries of justice,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>that ropes, even wings, could they be procured, would be
unavailing in a dungeon where the captive on his entrance
had to pass through thirteen different doors, each of which
was bolted after him. She had in fact other means in store,
and fortune favoured her in one particular, namely, that the
cross-grained commandant was summoned to a distant town
on military business, and Maria Grotius had already ingratiated
herself with Madame Deventer by occasional presents of
luxuries, to which the good lady was by no means insensible,
such as venison, poultry, and the like. When the books were
first allowed to enter the prison walls, the chest was submitted
on its entrance and exit to a strict search, which had of late
been deemed unnecessary.</p>

<p class='c016'>Accordingly, one day in the absence of the Governor,
Madame Grotius went to call on his wife, who always received
her kindly. ‘I am come,’ she said, ‘to ask you to help me.
My husband is killing himself, poring over those dreadful
folios, and making himself ill. We are both very grateful for
the permission granted that he should have the use of his own
library, but lately he has been working his brain, and tiring
his head over those tremendously heavy volumes, heavy in
every sense of the word, I want to send them away, and get
others lighter and smaller. Now, of course, your word is as
good as that of your husband in his absence. Do me the
kindness to order your men to carry down the chest as usual
to the water’s edge, and not demur because it is extra heavy.
I have a perfect spite against those bulky volumes.’ The
vice-regent of the commandant, ‘dressed in a little brief
authority,’ made use of it to oblige her friend, and gave the
order willingly. Maria went back to her own quarters.
‘Mother, dear,’ said Cornelia, the eldest of her children, ‘did
you not say to-morrow was the Fair at Gorcum, and that you
were told on such occasions even exiles and outlaws might
appear in the town? Why should not dear father go there in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>that case?’ Surely out of the child’s mouth came a word of
wisdom; she little knew that her remark was hailed as an
omen by her parents. Maria von Grotius next sent for her
maid, and asked her the startling question, ‘If we can conceal
your master in the book-chest, will you take charge of it to
Gorcum, and incur the whole risk?’—which was indeed great.
The loving wife would gladly have undertaken the task herself,
but she judged it would be more likely to avert suspicion
if she remained in the castle. The brave girl pledged herself
to carry out the directions of her mistress to the letter, and
the two women began their arduous and dangerous preparations.
It was the beginning of the week, and the month
March 1621, that Grotius rose early and, kneeling down by
the side of the empty trunk, prayed fervently for the success
of the hazardous enterprise. He was dressed in soft linen
and underclothing, and got into the chest, which was only
four feet long, and narrow in proportion, he being a tall and
strongly built man. His wife helped him to coil himself up,
and then placed a large Testament as a pillow for the beloved
head, the position of which she arranged so that the mouth
should come opposite the small holes she had drilled to admit
a little air. She closed the chest and sat on the top for a
considerable time, to ascertain if her husband could possibly
endure the confinement. Then lifting the lid once more, she
knelt down and took a solemn farewell of him she best loved
on earth, kissed him tenderly, locked the box, and gave the
key to the maid. We can only guess at the feelings of anguish
and tenderness which convulsed the heart of that noble woman
at that supreme instant. Then she arranged her husband’s
day-clothes on the chair, with his dressing slippers, and drew
the curtains closely round the bed, into which she got hastily.
After that she rang the bell, and when the servant who usually
waited on them answered the summons, she looked out and
said she was so sorry she could not go to Gorcum that day
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>for she was not well herself, and did not like to leave her
husband who was very ill; throwing out at the same time a
hint that he was feverish, and there might be fear of infection.
The servant said it was all the better she should not go, for
the river was swollen and the wind was high, and in fact it
was almost dangerous. ‘That is unfortunate,’ she said, ‘for
my husband resolved that these heavy folios should go to-day;
however, my maid is no coward, and she will take charge of
them, even if the ferry should be rough.’ She then bade him
go and summon the soldiers whom Madame Deventer had
told off to carry the chest. They came, and on lifting it one
of them said, ‘I believe the Arminian is inside, it is so confoundedly
heavy.’</p>

<p class='c016'>The poor wife trembling behind the closely drawn curtains
made some tame jest about the relative weight of a man and
those horrid books, and then the precious load was carried
out of the room. But Lieschen had many terrible moments
yet to come. The soldiers maintained, nothing but a man
could weigh so heavily, and one of them said he would get a
gimlet and run it into the Arminian, and another told anecdotes
of how malefactors had been smuggled out of prison in
a like manner. Poor Lieschen had to jest, while her heart
quaked: ‘Your gimlet must be a long one,’ she said, ‘to reach
my master in his bedroom in the castle.’ Then followed the
awful question, whether Madame Deventer would consider it
necessary to inspect the contents of the chest, which she
fortunately declined. So on the soldiers went, grumbling at
their heavy load, and when they arrived at the wharf, the
maid entreated that a double plank might be placed to carry
the chest on board, for, said she, ‘those books are to be
returned to a learned Professor, and I shall never be forgiven
if any mischance should befall them.’ At length the transport
was effected, and the large box deposited on the deck beside
Lieschen. The river was much swollen, the wind was raging,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>the vessel heeled over to one side, and the girl had to beseech
the skipper to have the box secured with ropes, and down she
sat beside it in an agony of terror, both for herself and her
precious charge. She then threw a white handkerchief over
her head and let the ends flutter in the breeze, the signal that
had been agreed on between her and her mistress to show so
far all was well and the vessel in motion; for a servant in
the castle had added to the women’s accumulated terror by
predicting that the captain would not embark in such a storm.</p>

<p class='c016'>The unhappy wife was straining her eyes, dimmed by tears,
between the bars of the window, while the maid sat shivering
with cold and fear, her head between her hands; and on the
top of the chest an officer of the garrison had taken up his
post, and drummed and pommelled with his feet against the
sides, and she dared not bid him desist from doing so—for
what reason could she assign for interference? At last she
bethought herself to ask him to get off, as there were not only
books but fragile china in the chest, and he might break it by
that constant shaking. The longest voyage, like the longest
day, will have an end, and surely that voyage from Loevenstein
to Gorcum must have seemed like one round the world to the
terrified girl; yet her fears did not deaden her woman’s wit,
and she was always ready with an answer. She bribed the
skipper and his son to transport the chest themselves to its
destination on a hand-barrow, beside which she walked. ‘Do
you hear what my boy says?’ observed the captain; ‘he declares
there is some living thing in your trunk, Miss.’ ‘No doubt,’
was the answer, with a forced laugh; ‘don’t you know that
Arminian books are alive, full of motion and spirit?’ In this
manner the three companions, with the fourth concealed,
threaded the dense crowds of the fair at Gorcum, and made
their way to a warehouse which Lieschen indicated. It
belonged to a well-to-do tradesman (relative of a learned
professor, a friend of the prisoner’s), and the wife was one of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>those whom Maria von Grotius frequently visited on her
marketing expeditions to Gorcum. The bearers of the chest
were exorbitant in their demands, but Lieschen was very
anxious to be relieved of their presence, and made little
haggling about the price. No sooner had they departed than
the poor girl hastened into the shop where the ribbon-dealer
and his wife were busy selling their wares, and stepping noiselessly
up to the latter, whispered the truth in her astonished
ear. The startled Vrouw became deathly pale, and seemed
like to faint, but she left the shop with Lieschen, and then
what a moment of condensed and mingled hope and terror!
Lieschen kneeled down and knocked. ‘Master, dear master,’
she exclaimed. No answer. ‘Oh my God, he is dead,’ cried
the girl, while her companion stood quaking with terror and
calling out it was a bad business. But hark! A feeble cry
from the inside, ‘Open quick, I was not sure of your voice.’
The chest was opened, and Grotius arose, almost as from a
tomb. The still terrified shopwoman took Lieschen and her
master into an upper room through a trap-door, and then
began to tell him how alarmed she was, and that she feared,
if he were found, her husband would be imprisoned in his
stead, and all their property forfeited. ‘No, no,’ said Grotius,
‘before I got into this trunk I prayed earnestly to God, who
has preserved me hitherto, but rather than ruin you and your
husband, I would get into the box again, and go back to
Loevenstein.’ ‘Oh no,’ said the kind-hearted woman, ‘we will
do all in our power to serve you’; and off she flew to her
brother-in-law, a clothier of Gorcum, whom she found in
conversation with the very officer who had been Lieschen’s
fellow-passenger, and who had annoyed her by sitting on the
trunk. Drawing her relative aside, the mercer’s wife explained
the whole state of the case, and bade him follow her to the
warehouse without a moment’s delay, when she would introduce
him to the fugitive.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>The clothier was nothing loath to be instrumental in the
escape of a man whom he greatly admired, being himself
no mean scholar, and well acquainted with the writings of
Grotius, on entering whose presence, he thus addressed
him, ‘Are you, sir, that man with whose name the whole of
Europe is now ringing?’</p>

<p class='c016'>‘I am Hugo Grotius,’ was the reply, ‘and into your hands
I commit my safety and my life.’</p>

<p class='c016'>No time was lost. The clothier, who was acquainted with
every one in Gorcum, found the man he could trust, a mason
working on a scaffolding in the town. He beckoned him
down, and told him there was an errand of mercy to be performed,
to which a large reward was appended, and asked if
he would undertake the task. The mason answered in the
affirmative, and was then directed to procure a set of working-men’s
clothes, which unfortunately proved too scanty for
Grotius, and thus occasioned a new difficulty; the trunk-hose
and sleeves were too short, the latter revealing the finely
shaped white hand, whose hardest labour had hitherto been
the work of the pen. The two women had much ado to patch
up and lengthen out, and with dirt and clay, putty and plaster,
they smeared the hands of the great philosopher, and sent him
forth with fear and trembling, to run the gauntlet of many
dangers. Next door was a library, which was the resort of
learned professors, and book-lovers of all kinds, to many of
whom Grotius was known by sight. He slouched his felt hat
over his eyes, took his measuring-wand in his hand, and
followed the mason through the streets to the bank of the
river, where the friendly clothier met them. The weather was
still boisterous, and the boatmen refused to ply, till the mason
urged on them the necessity he was under of fulfilling a contract
for buying stone for a large building at Altona, and
assured them he would be a considerable loser by delay.
These arguments were backed by the clothier, who put his hand
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>into his pocket, and drew forth the most convincing of all
arguments in the eyes of the boatmen. And at length the
embarkation was effected; the ferry crossed in safety, and
then the two masons walked to a neighbouring town, where
they hired a carriage, and entering into confidential talk with
the driver, informed him that the taller of the two was a disguised
bankrupt flying from his creditors into foreign territory,
and this, they said, would account for his wish to avoid
observation as they passed through the towns. On went the
little carriage, the driver of which was not long before he set
down Grotius as a fool who soon ‘parted with his money,’
for of its value he showed a profound ignorance. In this
respect we see that the driver differed in opinion from the rest
of the world. They travelled through the night, and on the
morrow, arriving early within a few leagues of Antwerp, they
were met by a patrol of soldiers, who challenged them, asked
for their passport, and inquired to whose service they belonged.
Grotius evaded the question, and added jestingly, ‘As to my
passport, that is in my feet.’ They fraternised, and the fugitive
had now not only a military escort, but a good horse provided
for his own riding; and in this manner entered the city of
Antwerp. He alighted at the house of a banished friend, who
proved to be in great anxiety on account of his wife’s illness,
so the daughter of the family informed him; but no sooner
did her parents learn the name of their unexpected visitor,
than not only the master of the house, but the invalid herself
hastened down to bid him welcome. The meeting was indeed
a happy one, and although secrecy was deemed prudent, yet
the news spread among a few compatriots, under the same
sentence of proscription, who all flocked to the house, where
a joyous little banquet was prepared, at which the illustrious
journeyman mason, still in his working clothes, presided. Conversation
flowed, and glasses clinked merrily that night to the
health of Grotius and his gallant Maria, not forgetting the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>brave and faithful handmaiden. In the meantime how went
affairs at Loevenstein? Madame Grotius had given out that
her husband’s illness was infectious; but no sooner was she
apprised of his safety, than she laughed her gaoler and his
guards to scorn. ‘Here is the cage,’ she said merrily, ‘but
the bird has flown!’ The commandant rained curses on her
head, and increased the rigour of her imprisonment. He went
across the river to browbeat the good shopwoman and her
husband, but all this fuming and fretting did not bring back
the prisoner. Madame Grotius sent a petition to the States-General
and to the Stadtholder, to which neither were
insensible. It was on this occasion that Prince Maurice
(who was not wont to measure his words) made the ungallant
speech—‘I thought that <i>black pig</i> would outwit us.’ We can
fancy he said it with a grim smile, for very shortly afterwards
Madame Grotius found herself at liberty, with the permission
to carry away all that belonged to her in Loevenstein.
Grotius, on his part, addressed a letter to the States-General
before leaving Antwerp, in which he maintained that he had
done his duty as Pensionary of Rotterdam, in the measures
he had advocated, thereby incurring their censure, and he
proceeded at length to propound his political views, and to
offer suggestions for the restoration and maintenance of
internal peace, concluding by justifying the means he had
used for escape, having employed ‘neither violence nor corruption.’
And he furthermore declared that the persecutions
he had suffered, and the hardships to which he had been
exposed, could never diminish his love for his country, for
whose prosperity he devoutly prayed.</p>

<p class='c016'>Grotius remained some time at Antwerp, and then determined
on proceeding to France, where his wife and family
were allowed to join him; and Lieschen, good, brave Lieschen,
who would not rejoice to hear that her fate was one usually
reserved for the last page of a story-book—‘she lived happy
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>ever afterwards,’ becoming the wife of her faithful fellow-servant,
who had learned the rudiments of law from his master
during their captivity,—a study which the good man continued
on leaving Loevenstein, and rose step by step until he
became a thriving and respected advocate in the tribunals of
Holland.</p>

<p class='c016'>But to return to Grotius: On his arrival in Paris he was
kindly received by the French King, who granted him a provisional
pension (very uncertain, by the way, in payment). In
a pleasant country-house which had been lent him, in the
environs of Senlis, he resumed his literary labours with great
assiduity, working first at his ‘Apology,’ which he wrote in his
mother-tongue, and sent off to Holland as soon as completed.
This was a full and detailed exposition of the motives which
had actuated his conduct, and of his religious and political
sentiments. It produced the greatest possible excitement in
Holland. The Government designated it as a foul and slanderous
libel, reflecting on the honour of the States, of the
Stadtholder, and all manner of bodies magisterial and municipal.
The publication was interdicted, and every person
forbidden, on pain of death, to retain it in their possession.
In the meantime the ‘Apology’ was published, and eagerly read
in Paris, and Grotius now set to work on his famous treatise
on the Rights of Peace and War.</p>

<p class='c016'>The pretty country-house in which he lived was the resort
of men of letters, and among his frequent visitors was the
learned De Thou, who gave him the free use of his valuable
library. In 1625, on the death of Prince Maurice, the exile
wrote to the new Stadtholder, Frederic Henry, asking permission
to return, but without success. He then sent his
wife into Holland, and through her judicious management
and the exertions of his friends, the reversal of the decree of
confiscation was obtained, and his property and effects were
restored to him. At length he ventured back to his own
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>country in person, and first proceeded to Rotterdam, where
he was cordially received in private, but the authorities would
not sanction his appearance in public, and the same reception
awaited him at Amsterdam and Delft. The States-General,
of whom he disdained to ask pardon (‘for,’ said he, ‘in what
have I offended?’) were exasperated at his boldness in venturing
back without permission, and orders were given to seize
his person, and give notice to the Government, while a reward
of 2000 florins was offered for his capture; but Grotius was
too much beloved; no one was found to betray him. Still
his position was undoubtedly perilous, and joining his wife on
her return from Zeeland, they took up their abode for the
summer and winter in or near the town of Hamburg.</p>

<p class='c016'>Grotius was now overwhelmed with proposals of employment,
and overtures of all descriptions from foreign powers—Spain,
Poland, the Duchy of Holstein, and the hero Gustavus
Adolphus, King of Sweden, for whom our philosopher had
the profoundest veneration. With this monarch’s envoy at
the French Court, Benedict Oxenstiern, a relative of the
celebrated Chancellor, Grotius had formed an intimate friendship,
and when they were both residing at Frankfort, they
became almost inseparable. The King of Sweden died, and
was succeeded by his daughter, the eccentric Christina, whose
admiration for the fame of Grotius even exceeded that of her
father. Through the medium of Oxenstiern she made him
numerous offers, but Grotius declined all but one employment.
He volunteered to return to Paris as the Swedish
Ambassador, provided the Queen would allow him a sufficient
salary to maintain his position as her representative, which
nomination was most distasteful to Richelieu, who was then
Prime Minister. But after a time his opposition was overruled,
and Grotius made his public entry into the French
capital, where the crooked and tortuous policy pursued by
Richelieu, and continued by his successor, Cardinal Mazarin,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>was most distasteful to Christina’s envoy, added to which he
was weary of politics, diplomacy, and Court life, and earnestly
solicited his recall. Christina acquiesced in the demand, but
desired him to repair to Stockholm, where she joined him.
Her Majesty did all in her power by promises of provision
and favour for himself, his wife, and family, to induce Grotius
to become a resident in her country. But he withstood
all her tempting offers. Many difficulties to his departure
were thrown in his way, but at last he embarked on a
vessel bound for Lubeck. He had not been long at sea before
a tremendous storm arose, and after three days continual
tossing, and constant danger of shipwreck, the passengers
landed on the coast of Pomerania, about fourteen miles from
Dantzig. Grotius was far from well when he left Stockholm;
the climate had proved too cold for him. He had been very
ill on the voyage, and after travelling sixty miles in an open
wagon, exposed to violent wind and rain, he arrived at Rostock
in a most enfeebled condition. No sooner had he
arrived than he sent for the doctor and the clergyman, who
thus describes his interview in a letter: ‘If you are anxious
to know how that Phœnix of literature, Hugo Grotius, behaved
in his last moments, I will tell you. He sent for me at night.
I found him almost at the point of death, and told him how
deeply I regretted that I had never seen him in health, to benefit
by his conversation. “God has ordered it otherwise,” he said.
I then bade him prepare for a happier life; to acknowledge and
repent his sins, and, chancing to allude to the Pharisee and
the publican, “I am that publican,” he exclaimed. When I
told him to have recourse to Jesus Christ, without whom is no
salvation, he answered: “In Him alone I place my trust.”
Then I repeated aloud the German prayer that begins, “Herr
Jesu.” He followed in a low voice with clasped hands. I
inquired if he understood all, and he said, “Quite well.” I
continued to read passages of the Word of God for dying
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>persons.’ Thus expired this great and good man, far from the
kindred he loved, his heart still true to the country which
had rejected and expelled him, his deathbed watched by
strangers. His body was embalmed and transported to his
native city of Delft, where it was interred with great pomp by
his fellow-citizens, who at first proposed to erect a statue in
his honour, similar to that of Erasmus at Rotterdam, but the
idea was abandoned. It was reserved for his descendants to
raise a monument to his memory in the said church. We
transcribe the modest epitaph written by Grotius on himself—</p>

</div><p class='drop-capi1_1'>
THE eldest son of Sir William Wentworth of
Wentworth Wodehouse, County York, by
Anne Atkinson of Stowel, County Gloucester.
He succeeded his father in his large estates
when only twenty-one, being already the
husband of ‘a fair wife.’</p>

<p class='c016'>Shortly after his succession he was elected M.P. for York
and <i>Custos Rotulorum</i> in place of Lord Savile, superseded on
account of misconduct, an office from which the Duke of
Buckingham requested him to retire that Lord Savile might
be reinstated, a proceeding which nettled the high spirit of
Sir Thomas, who wrote a refusal so indignant as to make a
lifelong enemy of the favourite.</p>

<p class='c016'>Until the accession of Charles the First, Wentworth,
although a silent member of the House of Commons, was a
zealous advocate of the Liberal party and a strenuous opposer of
the encroachments of the Court. Through the instrumentality
of Buckingham he was disqualified from voting by having the
post of High Sheriff thrust upon him, and he was soon after
summarily dismissed from his office of <i>Custos Rotulorum</i>. In
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>the ensuing year he was summoned before the Council and
sentenced to imprisonment for refusing to contribute to a loan
(levied without the consent of Parliament), on which occasion
he made a noble speech expressing his loyalty to the person of
Charles the First and his desire to serve him in any way consistent
with his duty to his country. On his release from
prison he became a strong leader of the Opposition and an
eloquent advocate of the famous ‘Petition of Rights,’ to which
the King was compelled to yield his unwilling consent. Then
suddenly came the adoption of that line of conduct, so differently
judged and so differently accounted for by different
biographers. Wentworth declared his conviction that the
nation might now be content with the concessions made by
the Crown, bade adieu to the party of the ‘Pyms and the
Prynnes,’ walked over to the other side of the House and
offered his services, head, heart, and sword, to the royal cause.
By some he was termed a traitor, a time-server, an apostate,
while others upheld the conduct of a man who chose the
moment of impending danger to rally round the unsteady
throne and the unpopular sovereign. Charles naturally received
him with open arms, and loaded him with favours; but
his old ally, Pym, meeting him one day, uttered these ominous
words, ‘You are going to leave us, but I will never leave
you while you have ahead on your shoulders’; words too
cruelly redeemed.</p>

<p class='c016'>The murder of the Duke of Buckingham made way for
Wentworth’s advancement. Raised to the peerage by the
title of Viscount Wentworth, he was appointed Lord-Deputy
and Commander-in-Chief in Ireland, and sailed for that
‘distressful country’ with a code for his own government,
drawn up by himself, in his pocket, from which he never
swerved. Lord Wentworth’s administration of Irish affairs,
his transient popularity, his reforms in matters civil, military,
and religious, his quarrels with the Irish nobles, his punctilio
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>in minute questions of form and ceremony, his hurried voyages
to and from England, are subjects intimately connected with
the history of the times, but too lengthy to be detailed here.
It would have been well for the Lord-Deputy if he had taken
the advice of his lifelong friend and correspondent, Archbishop
Laud, and had curbed his impetuosity on many
occasions.</p>

<p class='c016'>In 1639 he crossed to England, was created Earl of Strafford,
gained the title of Lord-Lieutenant of Ireland, was
received into the King’s full confidence, and was for a time
virtually Prime Minister. Not content with advocating the
necessities of raising subsidies, he contributed £20,000 from
his own privy purse (as an example to the nation) towards the
impending war with Scotland. In spite of ill-health and
increasing infirmities, Strafford crossed and recrossed St.
George’s Channel to attend to his duties on either side; the
last time in a terrible storm, and nearly died at Chester, on his
road to London. Yet his indomitable spirit would not yield.
He joined the King at York, and found the army in a sad
plight, all hope and spirit fled, and the royal cause ‘in the
dust.’ He became the real, though not the nominal, Commander-in-chief,
and although unable to walk, and scarcely
able to sit upright on his saddle, Strafford rallied the troops,
upbraided the sluggishness of the leaders, and set a brilliant
example of energy and courage. But the King stayed his
hand and thwarted his activity, loud all the while in his
praises, and giving him the Garter. Charles also insisted that
they should travel together to London, a proceeding to which
Strafford was strongly opposed,—two victims hastening to their
doom.</p>

<p class='c016'>A few days after the opening of Parliament Pym began his
long-meditated attack on his former friend—the blood-hounds
were on the track, the hunt was up. Our limited space forbids
us to do more than glance at the circumstances of Strafford’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>arrest and trial, but in truth it is a well-known tale. He was
impeached by Pym of high treason, compelled to listen to the
charge on his knees, was given into custody, and lodged in the
Tower. There is extant a most graphic description of the
scene which Westminster Hall presented on the occasion of
the trial, crowded to the roof, the King and Queen being
present, and the whole court and nobility of England, ladies of
the highest rank, whose tears flowed copiously, and whose
verdict was unanimous in favour of the illustrious prisoner.
It was well said by the elder Disraeli, that ‘Strafford’s
eloquence was so great as to perpetuate the sympathy which
he received in the hour of his agony.’ He had indeed need
of his eloquence. Every obstacle was thrown in his way,
especially in the matter of summoning witnesses, while his
personal enemies were invited from all parts of the country.
His confidence was betrayed, his words perverted, the whole
proceedings were unlawful and unprecedented, and the Solicitor-General
heaped insults on the accused. A Bill of Attainder
was provided, and the few individuals who gave negative votes
had their names posted up in the City as Straffordians.</p>

<p class='c016'>There was a passage of arms between the two Houses on the
subject, but the vultures were hovering round, and would not
be disappointed of their prey. Thomas Wentworth, Earl of
Strafford, was declared guilty of high treason. On this sad
passage, the saddest of all in Charles’s sad life, we need not
dwell long. He had pledged his royal word to his noble
friend, ‘You shall not suffer in honour, in fortune, or in life.’
Yet after some hesitation and delay, weeping all the time, he
signed the death-warrant, laying up for himself hours of deep
remorse during the few years he survived. The generous
prisoner wrote to his master, indeed, to absolve him from his
promise; but when he learned he was to prepare for death,
he raised his eyes to heaven exclaiming, ‘Put not your trust
in princes, or in any child of man.’</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>During the short interval between the sentence and the
execution, the captive busied himself in settling his worldly
affairs, writing wise, tender, and pathetic letters to his relatives,
and devoting his mind to the fulfilment of his religious duties.</p>

<p class='c016'>An earnest request to be allowed to visit his attached friend
and fellow-prisoner, Archbishop Laud, was cruelly refused, and
he was only permitted to send him a message, entreating the
prelate’s blessing as he passed to execution. Accordingly,
on the 12th of May 1641, Strafford, on his way to the scaffold,
raised his eyes to the window of the cell where the Archbishop
was confined, and perceived the aged and trembling
hand waving through the bars a solemn farewell to the man
he had so long and so faithfully loved. Thousands of spectators
lined the streets, the passions of the mob had been so
excited against the prisoner that the guards kept close to the
carriage lest he should be torn to pieces. Strafford smiled
calmly, and remarked it would matter little to him whether he
died by the hands of the executioner or by those of the people.
‘He had faced death too often to fear it in any shape.’</p>

<p class='c016'>His friend, Archbishop Ussher, and his brother, Sir George
Wentworth, were already on the platform. Strafford spoke
for some time. He declared that his whole aim through life
had been the joint and individual prosperity of the King and
the people, although he had had the misfortune to be misconstrued.
He denied all the charges brought against him,
asked forgiveness of all men he had injured, and prayed ‘that
we may all meet eternally in heaven, where sad thoughts shall
be driven from our hearts, and tears wiped from our eyes.’
Then he bade farewell to those near him, embracing his
brother, by whom he sent tender messages to his wife and
children. ‘One stroke,’ he said, ‘will make my wife husbandless,
my children fatherless, my servants masterless; but let
God be to you and to them all in all.’ Taking off his doublet,
he thanked God he could do so as cheerfully as ever he did
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>when going to bed. Then he forgave the executioner and all
the world. It was indeed an imposing scene,—Strafford on
that momentous day apparently restored to all the energy of
health and vigour, his symmetrical form, his regular features,
with a complexion ‘pallid but manly.’ Once more he knelt
in prayer between the Archbishop and the Minister, tried the
block, and having warned the executioner that he would give
the sign, stretched forth his white and beautifully formed
hands, which Vandyck has immortalised, which Henrietta
Maria, his sworn enemy, had pronounced the finest in the
world; and one stroke from the cruel axe ended the mortal
career of Thomas, Earl of Strafford.</p>

<p class='c016'>He was thrice married,—first, to Lady Margaret Clifford,
who died childless; secondly, to Lady Arabella Holles,
daughter to the Earl of Clare, by whom he had one son and
two daughters; and thirdly, to Elizabeth, daughter of Sir
Godfrey Rhodes (the marriage was a clandestine one), from
whom he was separated for a period immediately after the
ceremony, and it was some time before he would acknowledge
her openly; in fact a mystery hung over the whole matter.
Lord Strafford’s letters to this lady during his trial were
couched in affectionate terms. She bore him several children,
one of whom alone survived him. Of his connection with
that beautiful schemer, Lady Carlisle, born Percy, there can
be no doubt,—‘she who,’ says Sir Philip Warwick, ‘changed
her gallant from Strafford to Pym, thus going over to his
deadly enemy’; but there were many other names coupled
with that of Lord Strafford, apparently without any reason,
save the love of slander.</p>

HE was the youngest son of Francis, fourth
Earl of Bedford, by Catherine Bridges. He
served with distinction in the royal army
under Charles the First, and at the Restoration
was appointed Colonel of the first
regiment of the Foot Guards. At one time
there were negotiations carrying on for his marriage with a
daughter of the Earl of Bath, which was prevented by the
young lady’s family, who were desirous she should marry her
cousin, heir to the Earldom of Bath. The gallant colonel
then became a suitor for the hand of the famous beauty La
Belle Hamilton. There is a laughable description of him in
the <i>Memoires de Grammont</i>, and we cannot but think that as
the chronicler himself carried off the prize, he might have been
rather more generous in his delineation of an unsuccessful
rival:</p>

<p class='c016'>‘M. Le Colonel Russell avoit bien soixante ans, son

civiles. Il n’y avoit pas longtemps qu’on avoit quitté le ridicule,

vieux Russell, effraié d’une chute si terrible, voulut prendre

HE was the only son of William Russell, called
the Heroic Baron of Thornhaugh, whom he
accompanied to Ireland when only nine years
old. A curious picture at Woburn leads us
to believe that the young Francis shared his
father’s love of sport, being there represented
in a white hunting jacket with green hose, a hawk on his hand,
and two dogs in couples beside him. He was knighted in
1604 by James the First, at Whitehall, and the ensuing year
he married Catherine, daughter and co-heir of Gyles Brydges,
third Lord Chandos, with whom he lived very happily; and
during the first years of his marriage he devoted himself to
domestic life, and took great delight in study. Having
received a legal education he prosecuted his researches into
questions of law, parliamentary privileges and the like, which
were destined to prove useful to him in his public career.
He succeeded his father, as Baron Thornhaugh, in 1613;
and his cousin, Edward Russell, in the Earldom of Bedford
in 1627. He frequented the society of such men as Sir
Robert Cotton, Selden, Eliott, and was ever ready, says
<span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>one of his biographers, to uphold the liberty of the
subject against such despots as James the First. On
the accession of Charles the First, Lord Bedford continued
the same independent line of conduct, and several times fell
under the displeasure of the Court. In 1628 he distinguished
himself by his steadfast advocacy of the famous Petition of
Rights (to which Charles was in the end compelled to give an
unwilling consent); and he received in consequence the royal
commands to betake himself to the distant county of Devonshire,
of which he was Lord-Lieutenant. Both political bias
and private friendship attached him to the so-called popular
party, which laid down as their principle for action ‘to prescribe
limits to the monarchical power.’ The profession of
such opinions naturally led to the fact that Lord Bedford,
among many others, became an object of suspicion to the
Court. A rumour was set on foot that he had been instrumental
in the circulation of a seditious pamphlet, and on this
plea he was arrested and imprisoned for a short time. In
1630 he took a prominent part in the drainage of the Fens in
the centre of England, including the counties of North Hants,
Lincoln, Hunts, Bedford, Cambridge, and Norfolk; called
the Great Level, and subsequently in his honour the Bedford
Level. In 1637 this generous and public-minded man had
expended for his own share of this great work £100,000, but
he was not destined to witness its completion. The part
that Lord Bedford took in the political events of the day—in
the struggles between King and Parliament, in the differences
with the Scots—is not all this written in the chronicles of the
civil wars of Charles the First’s disastrous reign? Suffice
it to say that some of the popular Lords, and Lord Bedford
in particular, became aware of the advisability of moderation,
and the necessity of curbing the headlong opposition of the
popular party. But we cannot do better than to quote the
eloquent words of the great historian Lord Clarendon (then
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>Mr. Hyde). He says: ‘This Lord was the person of the greatest
interest in the whole party, being of the best estate and best
understanding, and therefore most likely to govern the rest.’
He was also of great civility and good-nature, and though
occasionally hot-tempered, and for the moment impatient of
contradiction, yet his opinions were wise and moderate. He
was a good adviser to the King, and served him in the end
far better than many who cajoled and flattered him. Lord
Bedford was a man of strict religion, and withstood the
attempt to evict the bishops from the Upper House. He with
many others of the same party were sworn of the Privy
Council, and in this manner gained Charles’s ear, and exercised
some degree of influence over him in regulating and modifying
measures that appeared prejudicial to the common good.
He was selected to be one of the Lords Commissioners sent
to confer with the Scots in the hope to compose the long-existing
differences. The King liked to transact business
with him, and was inclined to listen to his suggestions as to
persons fitted to be appointed to offices of state. Indeed
Charles pressed upon Lord Bedford himself the post of Lord
Treasurer, ‘which the Bishop of London was as willing to lay
down as any one else could be to take up,’ but Lord Bedford
refused the office. He was one of the few Peers (to his
honour be it spoken) who exerted himself to the utmost to
save the life of Lord Strafford. He pleaded his cause vainly
with his colleague, the Earl of Essex; and finding him
inexorable, prevailed on Mr. Hyde (in a long interview he had
on the subject) to intercede with Lord Essex. He also
endeavoured to keep the King up to his original intention of
commuting or mitigating the sentence. He observed to Mr.
Hyde that he thought ‘the Earl of Strafford’s business was a
rock on which they would all split, and that he was sure the
passion of Parliament would undo the kingdom.’</p>

<p class='c016'>But a sudden attack of illness arrested Lord Bedford’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>useful and noble career. He was seized with the small-pox,
and on ascertaining the fact, his first step was to send away
his daughter, Lady Brooke, lest she should fall a victim
to the fell disease which wrought such havoc in the house
of Russell, seeing that his son and great-grandson both died
of the same. Lord Bedford was very much averse to the
treatment which his physician, Dr. Cragg, prescribed for him,
namely, to be kept a close prisoner to his bed. And when
forbidden to get up, he sighed dolefully and said, ‘Well, then,
I must die to observe your rules.’</p>

<p class='c016'>Dr. Cademan, a medical man who had advocated a
different treatment, published a pamphlet, which gave as
his opinion that Lord Bedford ‘had died of too much bed,
rather than of the small-pox.’ The same authority, speaking
of the Earl’s devotion, says: ‘I never saw the like, though I
have waited upon many who had no other business left but to
die well. Commending his body to be buried with decency,
but without pomp, his breath was spent before his hands and
eyes ceased to be lifted up to Heaven, as if his soul would
have carried his body along with it.’</p>

<p class='c016'>So passed away on the 9th of May 1641 Francis Russell,
called the wise Earl of Bedford, a loss to the unfortunate
Strafford, whose sentence was carried out in a few days; a loss
to the King, whose wholesome adviser he was; a loss to the
popular party, whose violence he would fain have curbed.
His death was universally mourned, and every mark of respect
paid to his memory. Three hundred coaches with Peers and
their servants attended; a long and solemn procession followed
the body on its road to Chenies, the burying-place of the
Russell family, with led horses, banners displayed, Garter
King-at-Arms, ‘all the pomp of heraldry and pride of power’;
and this great and good man was interred amid the prayers
and tears of a large multitude. His widow survived him
some years, and was then buried beside him.</p>

HE was born second son of William, fifth Earl,
afterwards first Duke, of Bedford. He went
with his elder brother, Lord Russell, to
Cambridge, and later travelled in his company,
and that of a learned tutor on the Continent.
At Augsburg the brothers separated,
and William proceeded to Lyons, whence his letters home
proved he amused himself very much, and amidst a gay
and brilliant society formed a close acquaintance with the
eccentric and celebrated ex-Queen, Christina of Sweden, who
appeared to have gained great influence over the young
Englishman, who evinced a great inclination for some time to
enter the Swedish army as a volunteer. His letters during his
sojourn in France, many of which were addressed to his tutor,
to whom he was much attached, do him honour. When <i>en
route</i> for England he fell sick at Paris, and finding himself,
as he writes, ‘at the gates of death,’ he assures his old friend
that he prays constantly to God to ‘give me grace that I may
employ in His service the life His mercy has spared to me.’</p>

<p class='c016'>On his arrival at home, William for a time devoted himself
to the care of his brother, then in ill-health, and to giving
his father assistance in domestic affairs. At the Restoration,
Lord Bedford and his family were marked out for favour, and
the Earl carried the sceptre at the Coronation, and soon after
William was elected member for Tavistock. Handsome,
accomplished, and nobly born, he became a shining light at
the brilliant Court of Charles the Second, but his tastes were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>too earnest, and his bias too virtuous to find any lasting satisfaction
in a society so frivolous and immoral. An early
attachment to a good and beautiful woman proved a strong
safeguard to the young courtier, which was crowned about the
year 1669, by a marriage, the happiness of which family and
historical records can vouch. It was indeed a well-assorted
union, the commencement of ‘domestic bliss,’ as the poet says,
‘the only happiness which has survived the Fall.’ William
Russell’s choice was Rachel, the daughter of the noble loyalist,
Thomas Wriothesley, Earl of Southampton, and the
daughter-in-law of the Earl of Carbery, being the widow of
his eldest son, Lord Vaughan. We refer our readers to our
sketch of Lady Russell’s life, who retained her widowed title
of Lady Vaughan until the death of William’s elder brother.
In the meantime he began his political career by a zealous and
conscientious attention to his parliamentary duties, and was
not long before he incurred the lasting animosity of the Duke
of York, and indeed of the King himself, by his zealous opposition
to many arbitrary measures proposed by the Court
party, which, in Russell’s opinion, were calculated to endanger
‘the liberty of the subject, the safety of the kingdom, and the
welfare of the Protestant religion.’ In 1679 he was made a
Privy Councillor, a dignity he did not long enjoy, for we read
shortly after ‘that the Lords Russell, Cavendish, and others,
finding the King’s heart and head were against popular councils,
and that their presence in Council could no longer prevent
pernicious measures, and not being willing to serve him
against the interests of their country, went to him together,
and desired him to excuse their attendance any more at
Council.’ The King gladly accepted their resignation, for he
wanted men who would promote his arbitrary measures, and
thus, says Smollett, ‘Lord Russell, one of the most popular
and virtuous men of the nation, quitted the Council Board.’</p>

<p class='c016'>He was a prominent promoter of the Bill of Exclusion to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>prevent the Duke of York, or any Papist whatsoever, from
succeeding to the Throne. When the Bill passed the Commons,
it was Lord Russell who carried it in person to the
Upper House, on which occasion he made a most eloquent
speech, and wound up by saying that in the event of changes
so occurring, he should be prevented living a Protestant, it
was his fixed resolution to die one. But all opposition to the
Papal succession was unavailing, and in 1681 the King dissolved
Parliament, by which means Lord Russell found himself
at liberty for a short space to indulge in the retirement
and pleasures of a happy home with the wife and children he
adored. But his country’s welfare was ever paramount in
his mind, and he kept up his interest in public affairs.</p>

<p class='c016'>During the ensuing summer the Prince of Orange visited
England, and had several interviews and confidential conversations
with Lord Russell, who, moreover, made himself doubly
obnoxious to the Court party by meeting the Duke of Monmouth
in his progress through the North, at the head of a considerable
body of men.</p>

<p class='c016'>In conversation with his domestic chaplain Lord Russell
once remarked that he was convinced he should one day fall
a sacrifice, since arbitrary government could never be set up
in England while he lived to oppose it, and that to the last drop
of his blood. And it was evident he took little pains to prevent
the fulfilment of his own prophecy. This was a period
of plots and counter-plots. There had been much talk lately
of a Popish plot, and now the Protestant, or Rye House Plot,
was said to have been discovered, the object of which, it was
affirmed, was to seize the persons of the King and Duke of
York on their return from Newmarket. The enemies of Lord
Russell, and several other noblemen, who participated in his
political views, were glad to take hold of any pretext to secure
the ruin of the men on whose downfall they were bent, and
many of the highest of England’s nobility were now loudly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>accused of being implicated in the conspiracy, and orders
were issued for their arrest. The Duke of Monmouth was
not forthcoming, but Lord Russell, strong in his own innocence,
refused to make his escape, though strongly urged to
do so by many of his friends. He disdained the notion of
flight, though from the beginning he gave himself up for lost.
So he sat calmly in his study awaiting the arrival of the
officers, to whom he made no resistance, and was conveyed
first to the Tower and thence to Newgate.</p>

<p class='c016'>Lord Essex was the next so-called conspirator apprehended,
and he also refused every argument for flight, saying that he
considered his own life not worth saving, if by drawing suspicion
on Lord Russell, so valuable a life as his, also should
be endangered. The Duke of Monmouth had it conveyed to
Lord Russell that he would willingly give himself up and share
his fate. But the noble prisoner answered it would be no
advantage to him that his friends should suffer, and so, on
the 13th of July 1683, William, Lord Russell, stood at the
bar of the Old Bailey on a charge of high treason. That very
morning the Lord Essex, who was only a prisoner of three
days’ standing, was found dead in the Tower with his throat
cut. This strange and melancholy event gave rise to conflicting
rumours. Many people were of opinion that there had
been foul play, and Evelyn was as surprised as he was
grieved, ‘My Lord Essex being so well known to me as a man
of sober and religious deportment.’ The news coming to
Westminster Hall on the very day of Lord Russell’s trial, was
said to have had no little influence on the verdict which the
jury returned. The prisoner’s demeanour during his examination
was marked by calm dignity and absence of any sign
of agitation, though he occasionally expostulated against the
injustice with which the proceedings were carried on. Being
asked how he wished to be tried, he replied, ‘By God
and my country.’ Alas! alas! the voices of Justice and of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>Mercy were alike unheard in the courts of law that day. The
prisoner represented that he had been kept in ignorance, until
the moment of his appearing at the bar, of the nature of the
charges which were to be brought against him, and that he
was allowed no time to select his own counsel, etc. etc. He
asked permission to employ the hand of another to take
notes of the evidence, upon which the Attorney-General
(resolved to deprive him of the help of any counsel) churlishly
replied, he might have one of his own servants to assist him.
‘Then,’ said Lord Russell, ‘the only assistance I will ask is
that of the lady beside me.’ At these words, says a contemporary
writer, ‘a thrill of anguish passed through the court’—a
moment of intense pathos, the frequent and glowing
records of which, by poet, painter, and historian, pale before
the vivid colouring of the fact itself: the noble prisoner
turning in his hour of utmost need to the gentle helpmate
beside him, his servant, in the literal acceptation of the word—for
who could love or serve him better? Rachel, Lady
Russell, rose with a calm she had borrowed from her husband’s
example. Crushing down and stifling the varied
emotions of sorrow, indignation, and apprehension, forcing
back the rising tears lest they should dim the vision of the
scribe, clenching the small white hand to restore its requisite
steadiness, Rachel stood motionless for an instant, with
every eye upon her—the cold scrutiny of the cruel judges,
the inquisitive stare of false friends and perjured witnesses,—while
the Attorney-General, in a more subdued tone of
voice, said, ‘As the lady pleases.’ She then with a firm
step left her husband’s side, and took up her post at the
table below. That picture still remains stamped on the
memory of her countrymen through the lapse of more than
two centuries, and many who only half remember the details
of that remarkable trial, and its undoubted importance as
regards subsequent events, still bear in mind the touching
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>episode of the beautiful secretary, the faithful servant, the
devoted wife and widow of William, Lord Russell. The
jury were not long in returning the verdict of Guilty,—‘an
act,’ says Rapin, ‘of the most crying injustice that ever was
perpetrated in England.’</p>

<p class='c016'>To the cruel and hideous sentence for the execution of
‘a traitor,’ which was read aloud in English (instead of
Latin) by his own desire, the prisoner listened with that
decency and composure, ‘which,’ Burnet tells us, ‘characterised
his whole behaviour during the trial; even as if the
issue were a matter of indifference to him.’ The result of
the proceedings produced an intense excitement. The most
strenuous efforts were made in all quarters to save Lord
Russell’s life both at home and abroad. It was intimated to
the King that M. de Ruvigny, a kinsman of Lady Russell’s
in favour at the Court of France, was coming over with a
special message from Louis the Fourteenth to intercede for
the prisoner; but Charles was said to have answered with
cruel levity that he should be ‘happy to receive M. de
Ruvigny, but that Lord Russell’s head would be off before
he arrived.’ Many men of position and influence waited on
the King in person, and argued with him on the bad effect
the execution would produce in many quarters. The
Duchess of Portsmouth had a large sum of money offered
to secure her interference, but all in vain. Then Lord
Russell’s ‘noble consort’ cast herself at the King’s feet, and
adjured him, by the memory of her father, the loyal and
gallant Southampton, to let his services atone for ‘the
errors into which honest but mistaken principles had seduced
her husband.’ This was the last instance of female weakness,
if it deserve the name, into which Rachel Russell was
betrayed. But Charles was inexorable. He whose weak
heart was too easily swayed by beauty, too frequently overcome
by emotion of a baser kind, remained impervious to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>the tears and anguish of this lovely and virtuous woman.
Even the scanty mercy of a short respite was denied her.
She rose from her knees, collected her courage, and from
that moment she fortified herself against the fatal blow, and
endeavoured by her example to strengthen the resolution of
her husband. ‘She gave me no disturbance,’ was one of the
touching tributes he paid her. Lord Cavendish sent a proposition
to the prisoner offering to facilitate his escape, even
to change clothes with him, and remain in his stead; but
Lord Russell returned a firm though grateful refusal, considering
the plan impracticable, unlawful, and dangerous to
his faithful friend, and so prepared quietly and calmly for
the end, expressing his conviction that the day of his execution
would not be so disturbing to him as the day of his
trial. The time allotted to him was short. He occupied
himself much in writing. He addressed a letter to the King,
which he intrusted to his uncle, Colonel John Russell, to
deliver to Charles immediately after the execution; a noble
and temperate letter, in which the writer hopes his Majesty
will excuse the presumption of an attainted man. He asks
pardon for anything he might have said or done that looked
like a want of respect to the King or duty to the Government.
He acquits himself of all designs (and goes on to
declare his ignorance of any such) against either King or
Government.</p>

<p class='c023'>‘Yet I do not deny that I have heard many
things, and said some, contrary to my duty, for which I have
asked God’s pardon, and do now humbly beg your Majesty’s.
I take the liberty to add <i>that though I have met with hard
measure, yet I forgive all concerned in it, from the highest to the
lowest</i>; and I pray God to bless your person and government,
and that the public peace and the true Protestant
religion may be preserved under you; and I crave leave to
end my days with this sincere protestation, that my heart
was ever devoted to that which I thought was your true
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>interest, in which, if I was mistaken, I hope that your displeasure
will end with my life, and that no part of it shall
fall on my wife and children, being the last petition that
will ever be offered from your Majesty’s most faithful, most
dutiful, and most obedient servant,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class='sc'>Russell</span>.</p>

<p class='c024'>‘<span class='sc'>Newgate</span>, <i>July 19, 1683</i>.’</p>

<p class='c022'>He further drew up a long and detailed defence and
explanation of his whole conduct, to be given by his own
hands to the Sheriffs on the scaffold,—a precious record,
preserved in letters of gold among the most cherished
archives at Woburn, the scene of the noble writer’s youth
and childhood.</p>

<p class='c016'>The evening before his death, after bidding adieu to some
of his friends, his wife and children came to take a last farewell.
He parted with them (tender father and devoted husband
as he was) in composed silence, and Lady Russell had
such control over herself that when she was gone he said,
‘The bitterness of death is past.’ ‘He talked,’ says Burnet,
‘at much length about her. It had rather grieved him that she
had run about so much beating every bush for his preservation,
but that, perhaps, it would be a mitigation of her sorrow
to feel she had done all in her power to save him.’ ‘Yet,’ he
said, ‘what a blessing it was that she had that magnanimity of
spirit joined to her tenderness as never to have desired him
to do a base thing for the saving of his own life; there was a
signal providence of God in giving him such a wife, with
birth, fortune, understanding, religion, and great kindness to
him. But her carriage in his extremity was above all! It was
a comfort to leave his children in such a mother’s hands,
who had promised him to take care of herself for his sake.’
Burnet further tells us that ‘the prisoner received the Sacrament
from Archbishop Tillotson with much devotion, and I
preached two short sermons, which he heard with great affection.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>He went into his chamber about midnight, and I stayed
the whole night in the adjoining room. He went to bed
about two in the morning, and was fast asleep about four,
when, by his desire, we called him. He was quickly dressed,
and lost no time in shaving, for he said he was not concerned
in his good looks that day. He went two or three times back
into his chamber to pray by himself, and then came and
prayed again with Tillotson and me. He drank a little tea
and some sherry, and then he said now he had done with
time, and was going to eternity. He asked what he should
give the executioner, and I told him ten guineas; he smiled,
and said it was a pretty thing to give a fee to have his head
cut off. The Sheriffs came about ten o’clock; Lord Cavendish
was waiting below to take leave of him. They embraced
very tenderly. Lord Russell on a second thought came back
and pressed Cavendish earnestly to apply himself more to
religion, telling him what great comfort and support he felt
from it now in his extremity. Tillotson and I went in the
coach with him. Some of the crowd wept, while others
insulted him; he was touched with the one expression, but
did not seem provoked by the other. He was singing psalms
most of the way, and said he hoped to sing better soon.
Looking at the great crowd he said ‘I hope I shall soon see a
much better assembly.’ He walked about the scaffold four or
five times, then he turned to the Sheriffs, and in presenting
the paper he protested his innocence of any design against the
King’s life, or any attempt to subvert the Government. He
prayed God to preserve the Protestant religion, and earnestly
wished that Protestants should love one another, and not
make way for Popery by their animosities. He forgave all his
enemies, and died in charity with all mankind. After this
he prayed again with Archbishop Tillotson, and more than
once by himself. Then William Russell stood erect, arranged
his dress, and, without the slightest change of countenance,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>laid his noble head upon the block, ‘which was struck off
(says Evelyn) by three butcherly strokes.’</p>

<p class='c016'>Five years afterwards when James the Second stood on
the brink of ruin, he did not disdain to apply to the Earl of
Bedford for help. ‘My Lord,’ he said, ‘you are an honest
man, and of great credit in the country, and can do me signal
service. ‘Ah, sire,’ replied the Earl, ‘I am old and feeble,
and can be of little use, but I once had a son who could have
assisted you, and he is no more.’ By which answer James
was so struck, that he could not speak for several moments.</p>

SON of Thomas Harvey of Folkestone, in Kent,
by Joan Hawke, and eldest of seven sons
and two daughters. The parents were well-to-do
people, who brought up their children
carefully and respectably. Mrs. Harvey seems
to have been a most estimable woman, if
we only believe one half the virtues ascribed to her on the
tablet in Folkestone Church, where she lies buried; the
epitaph, though couched in the eulogistic and lengthy style
which was the fashion of the day, is sufficiently characteristic
to merit insertion. The mother of a great man is in our eyes
always deserving of notice.</p>

<p class='c016'>‘She was a godly, harmless woman, a chaste, loving wife, a
charitable, quiet neighbour, a comfortable and friendly matron,
a provident housewife and tender mother. Elected of God,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>may her soul rest in heaven (as her body in this grave), to her
a happy advantage, to hers an unhappy loss.’</p>

<p class='c016'>When only ten years old William Harvey went to a
Grammar School, and subsequently to Caius College, Cambridge,
where, we are told, ‘he studied classics, dialectics, and
physics.’ It was the fashion of the day for young men of any
standing to finish their education on the Continent, in one or
other of those schools of learning and science which were indeed
the resort of the youth of all nations. Harvey fixed his choice
on Padua, then especially rich in eminent Professors in all
branches of learning. He had been early destined, both by
the wishes of his family and his own inclination, for the
medical profession; and at Padua, under the auspices of the
celebrated Fabricius of Acquapendente and others, our young
Englishman, whose zeal was equal to his intelligence, laid the
foundation of his future greatness, and made rapid strides in
the path of fame. He remained five years at Padua, and
before his departure, at the age of twenty-four, received his
doctor’s diploma, with ‘licence to practise in every land and
seat of learning.’ On his return to England he obtained his
doctor’s degree at his old University of Cambridge, after which
he settled in London, and married the daughter of one Lancelot
Brown, M.D. Harvey soon got into extensive practice, enlarged
his connection daily, and, while rising step by step in his
profession, made himself beloved (as is mostly the case with the
true disciple of St. Luke) by the skill and charity he exercised
among the poor and afflicted by whom he was surrounded.</p>

<p class='c016'>Before long he was elected a member of St. Bartholomew’s
Hospital, and subsequently Principal Physician of that
important establishment, where, in the course of his tenure,
he introduced the most stringent reforms and regulations,
which were considered needlessly severe by the younger
students, who had grown into habits of laxity and idleness.
But neither the duties of his office, nor his practice which he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>carried on outside the walls, were allowed to interfere in any
way with his literary labours. Making the profoundest
researches into every branch of medical science, perusing
and weighing the arguments of those very writers whom he
was destined to eclipse; he attracted the notice of King
James the First, one of whose redeeming qualities it was
to encourage learning, and who found great delight in the
society of eminent men. The King named Harvey Physician
Extraordinary, with a reversionary promise of the regular post
at Court when it should become vacant, which did not occur
till after the accession of Charles the First. He was also
body physician to several noblemen and gentlemen of
eminence, such as the Lord Chancellor Bacon and Thomas
Howard, Earl of Arundel, with whom he travelled on the
Continent. He was appointed Lecturer to the Royal College
of Physicians, in Amen Corner, where, with some interruptions
(through absence, Court duties, and other hindrances),
he continued for many years to attract and interest his
colleagues by his knowledge and eloquence. It was in the
course of these lectures that he first promulgated his
wondrous doctrines on the motions of the heart and the
circulation of the blood; a subject with which the name of
William Harvey is indissolubly connected. The theories that
had been hatching in his prolific mind for long now took
form and shape in his immortal work, which he dedicated
to King Charles, and to his own College. It was this work
(although one of many) which enriched the science of
medicine, and rendered his name immortal. The circulation
of the blood had from time immemorial been the theme
of dispute and discussion among men of all nations; but it
was reserved, says Birch, for William Harvey in 1628 to
publish a book which was the clearest, the shortest, and the
most convincing that had ever yet been written on the subject.
The startling discoveries, and the bold manner in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>which they were expounded, kindled a flame of antagonism
and rivalry in the medical world. Learned Professors, and
men who professed without learning, rose to denounce, to
question, to deny him even the merit of originality, for had
not the same theories been known to the ancients? To the
manifold attacks by which he was assailed Harvey maintained
for the most part a dignified silence, though compelled in
some cases to rise up and defend himself and his opinions
from adversaries, both English and foreign.</p>

<p class='c016'>In 1636 he accompanied his friend and patron, Thomas
Howard, Earl of Arundel, when that nobleman went on a
special mission to the Emperor of Germany. Harvey did
not neglect this opportunity of making the acquaintance of
all the eminent men of science in the country, who in their
turn were desirous (from mingled motives) of meeting a man
with whose name Europe was now ringing. In a conclave of
medical men at Nürnberg our doctor made a public declaration
of his professional faith, when he was met by the most
strenuous opposition. The learned Caspar Hoffman, in
particular, was so violent and unreasonable in his arguments,
that William Harvey, after listening with singular forbearance
for a considerable time, laid down the scalpel, which he held
and quietly left the apartment. It was in this expedition
with Lord Arundel that one of his Excellency’s gentlemen
told Aubrey that Lord Arundel was rendered very anxious
by the frequent explorings of his physician into the woods,
where was great fear, not only of wild beasts, but also of
thieves, and where, indeed, the doctor one time narrowly
escaped with life. But Harvey would not neglect the chance
of studying the strange trees and foreign plants, and adding
to his collection of toads, frogs, and the like, for the
purpose of experimenting upon them—was sometimes
like to be lost indeed, so that my Lord Ambassador
was angry with him. With all these contentions and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>animadversions we are not surprised to hear that at one time
Harvey’s practice declined, and Aubrey says, ‘He was
treated by many as a visionary and a madman, and though
everybody admired his anatomy, most people questioned his
therapeutics, so much so that his bills (<i>i.e.</i> recipes and prescriptions)
were not worth threepence.’ He now gave himself
up to the prosecution of his Court duties, and was indefatigable
in his attendance on the King. The relationship between
Charles and his physician was of the most friendly and
intimate nature. Harvey speaks of his royal master in terms
of true affection, while the King took great delight in frequenting
the doctor’s dissecting-room, and studying anatomy
and medicine under his tutelage. On the breaking out of
the civil wars Harvey became more than ever attached in
every sense of the word to the person of the King, following
him wheresoever he went, to court and camp. On their
return from Scotland our peace-loving doctor was present at the
battle of Edgehill, where Aubrey records a very characteristic,
and almost comical adventure. It was in 1642, during the
fight in question, that Harvey was intrusted with the care of
the Prince of Wales and the Duke of York. He accordingly
withdrew with his young charges to what he considered the
shelter of a hedge, and finding the time hang heavy on his
hands, he took a book from his pocket, which he began
calmly and leisurely to peruse, when a large bullet grazed
and disturbed the grass at his feet, and induced him to move
further from the heat of the battle. Again we quote Aubrey,
who met him at Oxford, where the Court then was, and
though ‘too young to become acquainted with so learned a
doctor,’ yet he remembers well how Harvey would come to
our College to the chambers of George Bathurst, tutor, who
kept hens for the hatching purposes in his rooms. Harvey
would break the eggs daily at intervals in order to watch the
different progress of formation towards the ‘perfect chick’;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>and all this with a view to the medical works he was writing.
How widely at variance were these calm studies compared
with the wild turmoil of political and military excitement by
which he was surrounded! The Wardenship of Merton
College becoming vacant by the resignation of Sir Matthew
Brent, a Parliamentarian, the King recommended Harvey
for the vacant post, which he obtained, but did not enjoy
long, for when Oxford surrendered to the Roundheads, Brent
resumed his office. We cannot be surprised to hear that so
loyal a subject as Harvey incurred the ire of Cromwell, and
on the doctor’s return to London he found his house sacked,
the furniture destroyed, and, worse than all, as he himself told
Aubrey, ‘No griefe was so crucifyinge as the loss of those papers
(treating of his medical experiences and experiments) which
neither love nor money could replace.’ It must have been
about the year 1646 that Dr. Harvey made up his mind to
resign his place at Court. Many reasons were given for this
step, many apologies made for his forsaking his royal master;
but he was near upon seventy, and it appears natural that a
man of so peaceful a nature and of such studious taste
should prefer a calmer existence than that of ‘following the
drum.’ His retirement not only enabled him to pursue the
bent of his inclinations and to indulge in contemplation, but
also to enjoy the society of his brothers, who were of that
number that verily dwelt together in unity. They held their
elder in honour and affection, and vied with each other in
welcoming him warmly to their respective homes. His next
brother Eliab seems to have been his favourite, as he made
his home for the most part either at the said Eliab’s London
residence of Cokaine House, near the Poultry, or at Roehampton,
in Surrey. On the leads of the former dwelling
the doctor was wont to pass many hours in contemplation,
arranging his different stations with a view to the
sun and wind. At Combe there were caverns specially
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>constructed in the garden for the physician to meditate, as he
always found darkness most conducive to thought. The
thrifty Eliab took William’s financial affairs in hand, which
he conducted with so much energy and discernment as to
increase his brother’s income, and enable him to indulge his
generous propensities towards private individuals and public
institutions. He became a munificent benefactor to his
beloved College of Physicians, both by gifts in his lifetime,
and bequest by testament. He enlarged the buildings, added
a wing, and a large hall for conference, endowed it with a
library and a museum, and, in fact, was so noble in his gifts
that the grateful College erected a statue in his honour, with
a long and flattering inscription. But, alas! all these valuable
additions, together with the whole edifice, were destroyed in
the Great Fire of London. At the age of seventy-one the
doctor’s energy remained so unabated, that not only did he
continue his literary labours, but he travelled to Italy with
his friend and disciple Sir George Brent. On the last day of
June 1657 William Harvey was stricken with the palsy, and,
on endeavouring to speak, found that he had lost the power to
do so. He ordered his apothecary by signs to ‘lett him blood,’
but this gave him no relief, and his professional knowledge
warned him that the end was approaching. He therefore sent
for his brother and nephews, to whom he himself delivered
some little token of affection, a watch or what not, bidding
them tenderly farewell, with dumb but eloquent signs of
affection. He died the same day as he was stricken. His
friend Aubrey exonerates him from the false charge of
having hastened his own death by drinking opium, which he
occasionally used as an alleviation of pain, but said Harvey
had ‘an easy passport.’</p>

<p class='c016'>A long train of his colleagues from the Royal College
attended his funeral, and Aubrey himself was one of the
bearers. He was buried at Hempstead, in Essex, and was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>‘lapped’ in a leaden case, which was shaped in form of the
body, with a label bearing the illustrious name of William
Harvey, M.D., on his breast.</p>

<p class='c016'>The last will and testament of men who lay claim to
any celebrity appear to us to merit notice as indicative of
character. Harvey’s will did not in any way belie his life. He
left his faithful steward and brother, Eliab Harvey, the bulk
of his property in money and land, as likewise (Aubrey
thinks out of tender sentiment) his silver coffee-pot; for the
brothers were wont to drink coffee together at a time when
it was reckoned an uncommon luxury, before coffee-houses
were prevalent in England. To all his other relations he left
small sums that they might purchase remembrances; to his
College, and to more than one hospital, generous bequests;
scarcely any one was forgotten. To his dear and learned
friend Mr. Thomas Hobbes £10, to Dr. Scarborough his
velvet embroidered gown, to another his case of silver-mounted
surgical instruments, and so on. Nor were his
faithful servants, who had tended him in sickness, forgotten;
‘the pretty young wench’ who waited on him at Oxford, and
to whom Aubrey alludes in jesting terms, in spite of Harvey’s
proverbial insensibility to female charms, proved a most
tender nurse, and was gratefully remembered. We hear very
little at any time about Mistress Harvey, or the esteem in which
her husband held her, but we are told she had a parrot,
whose prattle much amused the learned doctor.</p>

<p class='c016'>He corresponded with learned men, both at home and
abroad, and was linked in friendship with such men as
Hobbes, Robert Boyle, Cowley, and the like. By nature he
was hot-tempered and outspoken, although a courtier. He
rode to visit his patients on horseback, with a servant to
follow him on foot—‘a decent custom,’ Aubrey thinks, the
discontinuance of which he regrets. The same authority says
Harvey ‘was of the lowest stature, and an olivaster complexion,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>like unto wainscott; little eye, round, bright, and
black, and hair like the raven, but quite white before his
death,’ which could scarcely be wondered at, as he was then
eighty years of age. His friend, the learned Mr. Hobbes, says
that Harvey was ‘the only man, perhaps, who ever lived to
see his own doctrines established in his lifetime.’ This
statement, the truth of which appears more than questionable,
it is easy to imagine, was put forth under the influence of
mortified feeling on the part of the ‘philosopher of Malmesbury.’
We refer the reader who is curious in such research
to the catalogues of the principal scientific libraries, both
in England and on the Continent, for a list of this great physician’s
professional works, as their names alone would enlarge
in an inconvenient manner the bulk of our volume.</p>

HE was the eldest son of Francis Russell,
fourth Earl of Bedford, by Catherine
Brydges, daughter and co-heir of Lord
Chandos. He was educated at Magdalen
College, Oxford; and after travelling abroad
for two years, we are told he returned home
in 1634, a very handsome and accomplished gentleman. Of
his personal beauty and noble bearing the fine portrait of
William Russell, and Lord Digby, by Vandyck, bears undoubted
testimony. He had been created Knight of the
Bath at the coronation of Charles the First. The representative
of a high-born family, and heir to a very large fortune,
young Lord Russell was keenly watched by the match-makers
of the day. At that time three rival beauties divided
the admiration of the Court—Lady Elizabeth Cecil, Lady
Dorothy Sidney, and Lady Anne Carr, the only child of the
Earl and Countess of Somerset. She was born in the Tower
at the time of her mother’s imprisonment for the murder of
Sir Thomas Overbury, and had been brought up in total
ignorance of her parents’ ignominy. ‘The voice goes,’ says
a contemporary writer, ‘that young Russell bends somewhat
towards the Lady Anne Carr.’ One would not be surprised
to hear that Lord Bedford was most adverse to the union. He
trembled for the future welfare of his son, and the honour
of his house, for heavy was the blot on the young lady’s
‘scutcheon. He promised his consent to any other union his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>son should project; but it was too late: Lord Russell’s choice
was free no more, and the sequel proved the selection had
been for his own happiness, and that of the whole family.
The King interested himself in the cause of the young lovers,
and sent the Duke of Lennox to mediate with Lord Bedford
in the matter. Lord Somerset, with all his crimes on his
head, had proved himself the most tender and devoted of
fathers, giving his child an excellent and strictly virtuous
education, and he made every sacrifice in his power to give
her a good dowry, seeing that her poverty was an additional
obstacle to the marriage in Lord Bedford’s eyes; so
Somerset sold his house at Chiswick, his furniture, his plate
and jewels; in fact denuded himself of almost all he had, to
make settlements on Lady Anne, ‘for,’ said he to the Lord
Chamberlain, ‘if one of us is to be undone by the marriage,
let it be myself, rather than my own deserving child.’ And
so came about this marriage, and the lovely creature,
whose sweet innocent young face is familiar to all lovers of
Vandyck, became the wife of Lord Russell, and the future
mother of the patriot William.</p>

<p class='c016'>Lord Russell sat in Parliament for Tavistock, having for
colleague the famous Mr. Pym; but in the commencement
of his career he did not take much part in debate, but was
chiefly employed in carrying messages from the Lower to the
Upper House.</p>

<p class='c016'>The death of Francis, fourth Earl of Bedford, caused great
excitement in political circles, and the new Earl received a
deputation from the House of Peers expressive of condolence,
and the hope that ‘as soon as his Lordship’s sorrow would
allow him, he would take his seat, for no one could better
supply the place of his deceased father.’ These conjectures
were confirmed, for the new Lord followed in the footsteps of
his father, and in all the part he took in the coming struggles,
he was ever ready to support liberal and enlightened views,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>and to advocate what he considered necessary reforms;
withstanding undue encroachments on the part of the King.
He was, however, inclined to wise and moderate views from
the beginning, and deeply regretted the circumstances which
had led to civil dissension and open war; but the times were
too stormy, and the pressure of the political barometer too
high, to allow of a middle course. Disgusted with what he
considered the arbitrary measures and the obstinacy of the
King, Lord Bedford now espoused the cause of the Parliament,
and even accepted the post of General in their army.
He besieged the Royalist forces in Sherborne Castle, and afterwards,
on joining the Earl of Essex on the eve of the battle
of Edgehill, he accepted, under that general, the command of
the <i>corps de reserve</i>. His conduct in the action gained him
great distinction, as it was supposed to be owing to his skill
and courage that the defeat of the Parliamentarians was
averted, ‘for Lord Bedford brought up very gallantly amidst
a play of cannon.’ He was ever ready to propose and to
facilitate every means of pacification between Charles and his
people, but all these endeavours proving fruitless, and finding
himself in opposition to the <i>ultra</i> opinions and measures of
the Roundheads, he, with some other Lords, determined on
joining the King at Oxford. One of his biographers says, the
Earl of Bedford came to Oxford, had his introduction, made
a declaration of the motives which had actuated his past
conduct, and received a formal pardon under the Great Seal.
The King was naturally inclined to welcome so noble an
adherent, but was rather lukewarm in his manner, while the
Queen and the greater part of the courtiers treated him with
much discourtesy. He fought with the Royalists at the siege
of Gloucester and the battle of Newbury, where the gallant
Falkland was killed. The Parliament, infuriated at Lord
Bedford’s secession, sequestrated his estates; but this sentence
was reversed shortly after the battle of Marston Moor in 1644.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>The next year Lord Bedford, with Lord Carlisle and four
other Peers, who had come from the King’s quarters, went to
the House of Parliament and took the Covenant before the
Commissioners of the Great Seal; this being the only compliance
made by Lord Bedford with the faction he had
abandoned. He now retired from public life, absented himself
from Parliament, and sought that quiet and domestic peace
in the bosom of his family, for which it may be well imagined
he had often sighed amid the turmoil and strife of political
and military life. He repaired to his home at Woburn Abbey,
where, between the years 1645 and 1647, his royal master
visited him on three separate occasions. After the execution
of the King, and during the vicissitudes of the Commonwealth
and the Protectorate, Lord Bedford continued to live in
seclusion, and it was not until the Restoration (to which event
he contributed, as far as in him lay, both by his influence and
his aid in pecuniary matters) that he reappeared in public.
How ill was he repaid by an ungrateful and cruel King! Lord
Bedford carried St. Edward’s sceptre at the coronation of
Charles the Second, and some time after received the Blue
Ribbon of the Garter. He belonged to a large number of
loyal spirits, who, after assisting and rejoicing in the return of
the lawful Sovereign, experienced the most bitter disappointment
at the tyrannical and unconstitutional course pursued
by Charles, and following in the steps of his father, stood up
manfully against the encroachments on civil and religious
liberty; conduct which was supported and nobly carried out
in the House of Commons by his son William, Lord Russell,
whose union with Lady Vaughan about 1669 (better known
to history as Rachel, Lady Russell) was a source of unalloyed
satisfaction to Lord and Lady Bedford, to whom she became
a tender and devoted daughter. In the life of William, Lord
Russell, we have given full details of his political career, of
the animosity his independent line of conduct aroused in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>minds of the King and the Duke of York, of his arrest on the
false pretence of being implicated in the Rye House Plot, of
his unjust trial and hurried execution, particulars of which it
would be superfluous to repeat here. Lady Russell spent the
early days of her widowhood, and indeed the greater part of
her subsequent life, at Woburn, with her father-in-law, affording
and imparting sympathy. Lord Russell’s execution took
place in July 1683, and within a year his fond mother followed
him to the grave. Since the death of that beloved son, Lady
Bedford’s health had gradually declined; she pined away
silently, almost imperceptibly; but there is little doubt her
death was accelerated by a strange and unforeseen incident.
She was sitting one day in the gallery at Woburn, when her
attention was attracted by a pamphlet which contained the
whole history of her mother’s life, her marriage and divorce
from Lord Essex, and the tragedy connected with the murder
of Sir Thomas Overbury, together with the complicity of both
parents—the mother, whose memory she knew no reason to
despise, the father whom she fondly believed she had every
reason to adore. The next person who entered the room
found the unhappy woman senseless on the floor, the fatal
book beside her. It appears from some letters of her daughter-in-law
at the time, that the family not only believed that this
sad incident had hastened her death, but that if her life had
been spared, her reason would have been endangered.</p>

<p class='c016'>The remainder of Lord Bedford’s life is so intimately
bound up with that of his daughter-in-law and her children, that
we must refer the reader to our notice of Lady Russell for
further particulars, even the passage in which we have given
the account of the creation of the Dukedom, which honour was
doubly acceptable to the aged Duke, as a tribute to the
memory of his lamented son. His love for his grandchildren,
and the tender letters he writes to their mother on their
account, his delight in the society of Mistress Katey, his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>little playfellow of nine years old, when he was past eighty, all
vouch for the gentleness of heart which characterised the first
Duke of Bedford. He had lived to see his son’s memory
vindicated, his son’s widow honoured and sought after by
every class in the kingdom, beginning with the Sovereigns,
William and Mary; the attainder reversed, his grandchildren
prosperous, his grandson and heir married with his sanction
and approbation, and the family name, in which he had a
right to glory, respected through the kingdom. He was
ready to depart, and ‘now his daily prayer was to the effect
that the God in whom he had so humbly and faithfully trusted
would grant him an easy passage to the tomb.’ And never did
any person leave this world with greater inward peace, or
with less struggle and discomposure; his lamp of life was not
blown out: the oil wasted by degrees, nature was spent, and
he fell asleep on the 7th September 1700, aged eighty-seven.
He was buried at Chenies by the side of his beloved wife.</p>

HE was the fourth son of Frederic, Elector
Palatine (King of Bohemia), by Elizabeth,
Princess of England, daughter of James
the First. After the battle of Prague,
which wrecked their fortunes, the unhappy
ex-King and Queen were driven from their
palace at Prague, compelled to fly for their lives by unfrequented
roads, and through the blinding snowstorms,
which impeded the progress of their coach, and from which
the fugitives were obliged to alight, and take horse.</p>

<p class='c016'>Elizabeth displayed the utmost courage and fortitude,
despite the intensity of the weather and the delicacy of her
health, and mounted gladly on a pillion behind a young
English volunteer of the name of Hopton, who would often
speak in after-days with love and veneration of his royal
fellow-traveller, the Queen of Hearts, the only sovereignty
that was now left her. In their distress the unhappy pair
sought about for some place of shelter where Elizabeth might
be cared for in her hour of approaching trial and her husband
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>appealed to his brother-in-law, George William of
Brandenburg, for the loan of one of his castles, either of
Spandau or Custrine. The answer was a grudging permission
to inhabit the latter residence, although the owner assured
Frederic it was no place for a Queen just fresh from a palace;
that it was not commodious or safe from the incursions of
their enemies; and, moreover, they would be exposed to cold
and famine, as there was no fuel and no food. The fugitives
found this account but too true, and even this surly
permission would have been withheld but for the intercession
of the British Envoy, Wotton. Moreover, their parsimonious
host bargained with his needy relatives to defray all expenses,
but Elizabeth’s condition allowed of no alternative.
Three days after their arrival Prince Maurice was born in
this dreary old barrack, with its bare walls and unfurnished
interior—a strange contrast to the scene of splendour and
festivity which characterised the birth of his brother Rupert.
Before the proper time had elapsed that it was advisable for
her to travel, the ex-Queen was hurried away, accompanied
by little Rupert, to Wolfenbüttel, and afterwards to the
Hague, where she found a generous protector and devoted
friend in the Stadtholder; the new-born infant being despatched
to the care of his widowed grandmother, the
Electress Juliana, in Polish Russia. Poor child! he had not
the traditional good fortune of one born on Christmas Day.
From his earliest childhood he bore his brother Rupert the
most devoted affection, and through their lives they were
brothers in very truth—brothers in arms and affection;
their paths strangely intertwined for soldiers of fortune;
they were both prematurely brave, and early initiated into
the profession they so much adorned. When together at
the siege of Breda, Maurice, waking in the night, heard a
noise for which he could not account, so he roused
Rupert, and they crept out together in the dark, and were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>just in time to save the garrison from a surprise. In 1638
Prince Maurice prosecuted his studies at a French University,
and in 1642 gained permission to accompany Rupert,
who had been appointed to a high command in the army
of their uncle, Charles the First. This gallant pair vied
with each other in loyalty and devotion to the English
King. Their bravery, their exploits, the various commands
they filled, the numerous actions in which they fought (frequently
side by side), all these incidents belong to the
chronicles of the civil wars of the period. In 1646 the
brothers left England, Prince Rupert proceeding to St. Germain
to join the Queen-mother there in exile, while Prince
Maurice embarked for Holland. The subsequent life of
this Prince appears to have been almost entirely passed
on the decks of the varied vessels which he in turn commanded,
for both he and Rupert secured glory and renown
on the broad ocean, as they had already done in the battlefield,
and their voyages were frequently made in company.
In the notice of the elder, we have given the account of a
touching episode in the lives of the two brothers, which we
therefore omit here. But Maurice was doomed to find a
watery grave in the year 1653, in a hurricane which overtook
his vessel off the Virgin Islands. The following is a
description of the tragic event: ‘In this fatal wreck, besides
many great gentlemen and others, the sea, to glut itself,
swallowed the Prince, whose fame the mouth of detraction
cannot blast. His very enemies bewailed his loss. Many
had more power, few more merit; he lived beloved, and
died bewailed.’ Two years after his death there was a
rumour that he still lived (but the false report soon died
away), that he had been captured by a pirate, and was a slave
in Africa, but this unlikely tale gained little or no credence.</p>

HE was the second born but only surviving son
of the third Earl, by Elizabeth, daughter of
John Vernon of Hodnet, County Salop.
Educated at Eton and Oxford, where he distinguished
himself, and afterwards travelled
abroad; remained some time in France,
where he probably espoused his first wife, and afterwards
proceeded to the Low Countries. His father and elder
brother had also gone thither, and were attacked by fever.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>The youth died, and his father (travelling before it was prudent
for him to do so), borne down by sorrow, soon followed
his beloved child to the grave. Thomas, who had now
become Earl of Southampton, found on his return to England
that public affairs were in great confusion. The Parliamentarians
did all in their power to gain over the young nobleman
to their side, but he disapproved of their proceedings,
and would take no part in them. He was soon after appointed
Privy Councillor and Lord of the Bedchamber to the King,
and became henceforth, in every sense of the word, attached
to the royal person, to whom he was an excellent friend, often
giving him unpalatable advice. He used to sleep in the King’s
apartment, and to the best of his power soothed his hours of
mental anguish. In 1647, when the unhappy monarch fled
from Hampton Court, he took shelter at Titchfield, in Hampshire,
Lord Southampton’s country-house, and when brought
back to the palace in the hands of his enemies, his first request
was for the attendance of his trusty friend. This permission
was granted him, and Southampton was one of the last allowed
to remain with his royal master, and one of the four mourners
who paid the last sad duties to his remains. With Charles the
Second he kept up a continued correspondence, and supplied
the exile with large sums, hastening to meet him on his arrival
in England, when he was rewarded by being made Knight of
the Garter, as were other faithful adherents to the Crown, and
was shortly afterwards appointed Lord High Treasurer. In
this capacity he showed so much independence of spirit and
interest in the public welfare as to offend the King, who did
not, however, remove him from his office, which was exercised
by Southampton, although suffering from a terrible and painful
disease which made business occasionally irksome to him.
To his credit be it spoken, that during seven years’ management
of the Treasury he made but an ordinary fortune, disdaining
to sell places, as many of his predecessors had done.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>The Earl of Southampton was thrice married: first, to
Rachel, daughter of Daniel de Ruvigny, in France, by whom
he had two sons, who died young, and three daughters,
the second of whom was Rachel, the faithful wife and widow
of the patriot, William, Lord Russell; his second Countess
was Elizabeth, daughter and co-heir of Francis Booth, Lord
Dunsmore, by whom he had four girls; and his third wife
was the daughter of William, second Duke of Somerset,
and widow of Viscount Molyneux. He died at Southampton
House, in Bloomsbury, which he bequeathed to his daughter,
Lady Russell, and was buried at Titchfield. By his death
the title of Southampton in the Wriothesley family became
extinct.</p>

SIR George Goring of Hurstpierpoint,
County Sussex, was created in 1629 Baron
Goring, and in 1645 Earl of Norwich. He
married Mary, daughter of Edward Neville,
Lord Abergavenny. Their third eldest son
was George, the subject of this notice, who
distinguished himself greatly in the civil wars. He married
in early life Lady Lettice Boyle, daughter of the Earl of Cork.
He was wild, eccentric, and extravagant, and Lord Wentworth
(afterwards Earl of Strafford), speaking of him in a letter to
Lord Carlisle, 1633, says: ‘Young Mr. Goring is gone to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>travel, having run himself out of £8000, which he purposes
to redeem by frugality abroad, unless my Lord Cork can be
induced to put to his helping hand, which I have undertaken
to solicit for him the best I can, and shall do it with all the
power and care my credit and wit shall in any way suggest
unto me.’ The noble writer was successful in his negotiation,
and Lord Cork was most generous and liberal on this and
several other occasions to a son-in-law who gave him much
trouble. Not long after the marriage Lord Cork thus writes,
in speaking of George Goring: ‘After borrowing money from
me for himself and his father, he departed from us without
once taking leave of me, and leaving his wife and servants,
posted through Scotland on to England on the choice gray
gelding I bestowed upon him called Gray Brown, hath
much disquieted me, his wife, and friends.’ His poor wife
had good reason to be disquieted on this and many other
occasions, but she seems to have retained a real affection for
her unworthy husband, willing to join him at any summons,
and frequently interceding with her generous father for so-called
loans and large sums, which never appear to have been
repaid.</p>

<p class='c016'>George Goring, on his arrival in the Low Countries,
enlisted as a soldier, entered Lord Vere’s regiment, and soon
gained a high command, distinguishing himself at the siege of
Breda. On his return to England he was made Governor of
Portsmouth, in which capacity he got into trouble with the Parliament,
and was summoned before the House of Commons
on suspicion of favouring the Royal cause. Anxious to provide
for his own interests by pleasing both sides, he contrived to
give satisfaction to the Parliament, and was therefore exonerated.
Goring was indeed anything but straightforward in
his dealings; Lord Clarendon says of him: ‘He could help
himself with all the intimation of doubt, or fear, or shame, or
simplicity in his face that might gain belief to a greater degree
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>than I ever saw in any man, and could seem most confounded
when he was best resolved, and to want words when
they flowed from no man with greater power.’ He cajoled the
popular party, corresponded secretly with the King in 1642,
threw off the mask he had worn as adherent to the Parliament,
and declared openly that he held Portsmouth for Charles the
First. The town was besieged by sea and land, and surrendered
after a meagre defence; Goring stipulating that he
might be allowed to transport himself beyond the seas, which
caused great astonishment, as also did his appointment (on his
return in 1644) to the command of cavalry in the Royal army
in Lincolnshire. He now continued to distinguish himself
greatly in the service of the King, and was present in almost
every action. In 1646, his father being created Earl of Norwich,
he became Lord Goring, and held the commission of
Lieutenant-General of several counties, in which capacity he
did little good, setting a bad example to the troops by his
irregular and immoral conduct. Clarendon says of him that
he had a good understanding, a sharp wit, and keen courage,
but he did not value his promise or friendship according to
any rules of honour or integrity. ‘He loved no man so well
but he would cozen him and expose him to ridicule.’ The
same historian speaks of Goring’s immoderate ambition, dissimulation,
and want of religion. He continued his vacillating
line of conduct, and when in difficulties pleaded illness,
and gained permission to go to Bath for a cure, but returned
to active service, became a Privy Councillor, and had undeserved
favours showered upon him by the King. His whole
career was marked by contrasts of success and failure, courage
and blundering, and animosity towards those who like Prince
Rupert filled a high position, and stood well in the opinion
of others. After many vicissitudes he resolved to leave England,
and proceeded to the Netherlands, where he became
Lieutenant-General of the Spanish army, and afterwards
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>obtained the same command in Spain under Don John
de Silva, who, finding that he was in communication with
Cardinal Mazarin, had him seized at the head of his troops,
and sent prisoner to Madrid. Writers differ as to the termination
of this eccentric man’s career. Some say he was
put to death in prison for treason, and others that he entered
a monastery and died in the habit of a Dominican friar.</p>

<p class='c016'>Lord Goring had no children. Dying in the lifetime of
his father, Lord Norwich was succeeded by his second son,
Charles, who married Alice, daughter of Robert Leman, Esq.,
and widow of Sir Richard Baker, Knight, but having no
children the titles of Norwich and Goring became extinct.</p>

HE was the third son of Frederic, Elector
Palatine, and King of Bohemia, by Princess
Elizabeth of England, daughter of
James the First. Born at Prague during
the short-lived period of his parents’ prosperity,
while inhabiting the Palace of the
Bohemian capital. More than half a century had elapsed
since the birth of a royal Prince at Prague, and the event
was the occasion of great excitement and rejoicing. Persons
of all classes were invited to have a glimpse of the royal
infant, swathed in rich wrappings of gold and embroidery.
Nobles and ladies, burghers and their wives, officers of state,
soldiers, peasants, all flocked to the Palace, and clustered
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>round the cradle of the future hero. His father thought well
to name him Rupert, after the wise and fortunate Elector
who, on the death of Wenceslaus, ascended the Imperial
throne: and the ceremony of baptism was conducted on a
scale of great magnificence, which helped not a little to drain
the ill-filled coffers of Frederic and Elizabeth. On the other
hand, donations of all kinds poured in from the nobles, the
burghers, and their respective wives. Contributions of fruit
and flowers were presented by the poorer population, offerings
which were most graciously received by the gentle-hearted
mother.</p>

<p class='c016'>Her two elder sons were respectively heirs to titles
(alas! how empty) of King, and Elector Palatine. The
Bohemian Ministry, willing to do honour to a Prince born
‘in their midst,’ bestowed on the new-born babe the dignity
of Duke of Lithuania, which the child did not long enjoy,
seeing that a few months after his birth the decisive battle
of Prague was the means of driving his parents from their
newly-acquired kingdom, penniless and homeless wanderers,
compelled to solicit shelter and assistance from cold relatives
and fickle friends.</p>

<p class='c016'>Rupert was the only one of her children who accompanied
Elizabeth on her miserable flight from Custrin to
Holland (a circumstance to which we have alluded in the
sketch of his brother Maurice), where the ex-Queen with her
family resided for many years, and where five children were
born to her. Little Rupert was sent to the College at
Leyden, where his eldest brother Henry was a student, and
had already distinguished himself greatly. Amongst other
accomplishments, Henry was an elegant letter-writer, and kept
up a frequent correspondence with his mother. In one of
his letters he tells how ‘dear Rupert is a most lively boy,’
and amused the students when he first arrived by speaking
to them in Bohemian.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>A soldier at heart from his earliest childhood, Rupert did
not remain long at Leyden, but entered the army under
Henry Frederic of Nassau, and (Lodge tells us) was present
at the siege of Thynberg, although another biographer places
the date of his first action several years later. Be this as
it may, in 1637 he marched with his brother, Charles Louis,
who now called himself Elector Palatine (their father being
dead), against the Imperialists. The gallant Lord Craven
had constituted himself the guardian of ‘the Palatine
Princes,’ and accompanied them in the expedition, writing
frequently to their mother at the Hague, to give tidings of
Charles and the beloved Rupert. Lord Craven had warmly
espoused the cause of Frederic, and was now the devoted
friend of the royal widow and her family. He and his two
charges distinguished themselves during the siege of Lippe,
but being worsted in an encounter with General Hatzfeldt,
Charles Louis had a narrow escape of his life. He crossed
the river in his coach, and, clinging to the shrubs and underwood,
climbed up on the precipitous bank of the opposite
shore, and made his way to Holland. His brother and Lord
Craven were both taken prisoners by the Imperialists, and carried
to Vienna, where they were lodged in the castle. With much
difficulty Rupert found means to have a few lines conveyed
to his mother, wherein, after some tender expressions of
filial love and respect, he assured her that no power on
earth should induce him to renounce his party, or abjure
his faith. Lord Craven succeeded in regaining his freedom,
by paying the large ransom of £20,000; but all attempts
to procure the deliverance of Rupert proved unavailing. It
was only at the expiration of three years, and on condition
that he would undertake never again to bear arms against
the Emperor, that the young Prince was set at liberty,
shortly after which event he received an offer from his uncle,
Charles the First, of the command of the cavalry in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>Royal army, the King having unfurled his standard against
the Parliamentarians. He was accompanied by his brother
Maurice, whose love and admiration for his elder were
unbounded; and the exploits of these gallant Princes in the
service of their royal uncle, are they not written in the
books of the chronicles of the civil wars of England?</p>

<p class='c016'>After the execution of Charles the First Rupert received
a new commission from Charles the Second, and continued
to distinguish himself by sea and land; went to Portugal,
the Mediterranean, the French coast, Madeira, the Azores,
etc. etc.; encountered all kinds of dangers and vicissitudes,
reverses and successes. A more chequered life is scarcely
on record than that of Prince Rupert.</p>

<p class='c016'>Our space is too limited to admit of any lengthened
details of his adventures, ‘moving accidents by flood and
field,’ and of all his ‘hair-breadth ‘scapes’; but one passage
in his life is too full of romantic interest, and so characteristic
of the fraternal affection of the Palatine Princes, to be
passed over in silence. Captain Fearnes, who commanded
the fine ship <i>The Admiral</i>, gives a noble and touching
description of the incidents connected with the wreck of his
vessel. One of the most disastrous tempests ever recorded
in a seaman’s log overtook the English fleet, then cruising
among the Western Islands, and after every endeavour had
been made to save the ship without a chance of success,
Captain Fearnes, who survived the wreck, gives the following
report: ‘It was resolved that the ship must be our grave,
and every man very well resolved to die, and the minister
told us that as many as would receive the Sacrament he
would administer it, and desired that we would give him
notice, when we saw we were past all hope, to come to the
place appointed, there to receive it, and die all together.’</p>

<p class='c016'>Prince Rupert, believing his last moments were at hand,
waved his brother Maurice to bring his vessel, <i>The Honest</i>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span><i>Seaman</i>, under the Admiral’s stern, to bid his beloved
brother an eternal farewell, to give him his last directions
and express his last wishes. Maurice, regardless of his own
safety, commanded his men to lower a boat, either to save
Rupert, or to put him on board and let them die together.
His officers refused, as they said it would be to their own
destruction, and be of no avail in saving Rupert. They
made, indeed, a feint of lowering the boat, but paid little
heed to the agony of their commander. Then the crew
of <i>The Admiral</i> came to a noble decision. Deeply touched
by the devotion which his Highness displayed, they conjured
him to seek safety in the one little boat that was left them.
This he steadily refused, saying ‘that as they had run all risks
with him, so he would participate them.’ Thus did either try
to breathe their last in unspeakable magnanimity. The
brave seamen were not to be foiled; they elected a crew of
undaunted lads, hoisted out their boat, and by force thrust
their brave Prince into the same. He was put aboard <i>The
Honest Seaman</i>, and immediately sent back the skiff to save
as many as was possible, specifying the names of three officers,
one of whom alone (and that the captain in command)
accepted the offer. Fearnes was blamed by many for deserting
his ship’s company. He and the Prince’s servant were
boarded on one of the vessels, but the unfortunate little skiff
was swamped. The Prince strove in vain to approach <i>The
Admiral</i>, but it could not be done from stress of weather, and
the doomed crew waved a sad farewell from the deck of the
sinking ship to their comrades. In all, 333 men perished in
this fatal storm, but the whole story remains a glorious passage
in the annals of British seamen. Rupert’s regret for the loss
of a noble ship, with a rich freight on board, was little in comparison
with his grief for that of his valued messmates. He
was again threatened with a watery grave in a tremendous
hurricane which overtook the fleet when at a short distance
<span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>from the Virgin Islands, and in this fatal storm he had to
deplore the loss of his devoted friend and brother, Prince
Maurice, who went down on the deck of the well-named
<i>Honest Seaman</i>. Yet once more he had an escape from
drowning when at Paris at the Court of Louis the Fourteenth,
in company with Charles the Second. A letter from a Roundhead
thus details the circumstance:—</p>

<p class='c016'>‘The Seine had like to have made an end of your Black
Prince Rupert’ (he was swimming with the King and Duke of
York); ‘he was near being drowned if it had not been for the
help of one of his servants, who dragged him up by the hair
of his head.’ These ‘highly liveried blackamoors,’ like all
other dependants of the Prince, were much attached to their
noble master.</p>

<p class='c016'>On his return to England in 1662 Rupert seems to have
given himself up to the pursuit of philosophical and scientific
studies, even (so it was affirmed by many) to those of an occult
nature. He fitted up for himself a workshop in the High
Tower of Windsor Castle, furnished with forges, crucibles,
retorts, instruments of all sorts, and here ‘the hero of a
hundred fights’ might be seen with blacksmith’s apron and
bare brawny arms indulging in all the experiments of vital
interest to a chemist and an alchemist. In this laboratory he
was frequently visited by his royal cousin the King, and his
favourite the Duke of Buckingham, both of whom took a great
delight in Rupert’s occupations. This strange man had other
apartments assigned to him in the castle, where he kept stores
of armour and weapons from all parts of the world, together
with a library of valuable books, the catalogue of which is still
extant. John Evelyn was a great admirer of Rupert’s versatile
talents, and was a delighted listener when the Prince related
to him the discovery that he had made of mezzotint engraving.
The story is well known how on one occasion, when at
Brussels, the Prince observed a sentinel at some distance from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>his post very busy doing something to his piece. Rupert
asked what he was about; he replied the dew had fallen in
the night, had made his fusil rusty, and that he was scraping
and cleaning it. The Prince, examining the gun, was struck
with something like a figure eaten into the barrel with innumerable
little holes closed together like friezed work on
gold or silver, part of which the soldier had scraped away.
This suggested to the Prince a contrivance which resulted in
the discovery of mezzotint engraving, carried out in company
with his protégé, the painter, Wallerant Vaillant. Great
rivalry was excited on the occasion, and many people laid
claim to an invention which was clearly that of Rupert.</p>

<p class='c016'>Other discoveries and inventions of this wonderful man we
leave to his more complete biographers. He found time in
the midst of these engrossing pursuits to become enamoured
of the charms of Francisca Bard, daughter of Lord Bellamont,
by whom he had a son, on whose education he bestowed
much care. He was called Dudley Bard, and grew up to
emulate his father’s military ardour and undaunted courage,
but was killed at the siege of Buda in 1686, having just
attained his twentieth year.</p>

<p class='c016'>Negotiations were carried on at one time for an alliance
between Rupert and a member of a royal house, but came to
an end in consequence of the Prince’s slender means.</p>

<p class='c016'>In 1660 he once more embarked to oppose the French,
alternating his beloved studies with his military and naval
duties, but an old wound he had received in the head some
time before put him to great torture and endangered his life,
so much so that he was obliged to be trepanned. Requiring
rest after the operation, he joined the Merry Monarch’s
merry Court at Tunbridge Wells, and had not long been there
before he formed a connection with the fair Mistress Hughes,
an actress belonging to the King’s company, and one of the
earliest female performers, who began her theatrical career in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>1663, and gained great distinction in the character of Desdemona.
The fascinations of this lady had a softening and
refining influence on the manners and habits of his Highness,
and even his beloved studies were neglected for the delights
of her society. His dress was no longer neglected, and he
vied with the other courtiers of his royal cousin in gallantry and
compliments, but the beautiful comedian was not so easy of
access as most of her compeers, and it was some time before
she was induced to listen to her royal lover’s suit. He was
most lavish in his expenditure, grudging nothing to the fair
siren. He purchased for her the magnificent seat of Sir
Nicholas Crispe, near Hammersmith, afterwards the residence
of the Margrave of Brandenburg, which cost £25,000 in the
building.</p>

<p class='c016'>By her he had a daughter named Ruperta, married to
General Howe, of whom there is a most characteristic portrait
in the collection of the Earl of Sandwich at Hinchingbrook.
Mrs. Hughes remained on the stage for many years after
Prince Rupert’s death, who saw little of her in his later days,
but bequeathed a large property to her and her daughter.</p>

<p class='c016'>After leaving Tunbridge Wells he returned to Windsor,
and resumed his studies, until called once more into active
service. In 1673 he was appointed Lord High Admiral in
place of the Duke of York, and commanded the fleet against
the United Provinces, when, as usual, he distinguished himself.
On the 29th of November 1682 Prince Rupert died in
his house at Spring Gardens, ‘mourned and respected’ by
men of the most differing interests. A magnificent funeral
was allotted to him, and he was buried in Westminster Abbey.</p>

<p class='c016'>Count Grammont, in his Memoirs, gives anything but a
flattering description of the Prince’s personal appearance, but
we are more inclined to credit the testimony of such painters
as Honthorst, Lely, and Kneller, whose portraits are undoubtedly
noble and prepossessing.</p>

SHE was the second daughter of William, fifth

At an early age she gave much anxiety to

<p class='c016'>She was the second daughter of Charles, third
Lord Dormer, and second and last Earl of
Carnarvon (of that family), by Elizabeth,
daughter of Arthur, Lord Capel. She
married Sir Charles Coote, fourth Earl of
Mountrath, of a noble family of French
extraction, which settled first in Devonshire, and subsequently
in Ireland. Sir Charles Coote, for his loyalty and military
services, was, at the Restoration, created, with other honours,
Earl of Mountrath. It was his grandson, and third Earl of
Mountrath, who married the subject of this notice. He was
much considered at Court, carried the banner of Ireland at
the funeral of Queen Mary in 1694, was one of the Lords
Justices in 1696, and died in 1709. His grandson, the sixth
Earl, married Lady Diana Newport, daughter of the Earl of
Bradford.</p>

<p class='c016'>She was the daughter of Francis Newport,
first Earl of Bradford, by Lady Diana
Russell. She married, first, Thomas Howard
of Ashtead, County Surrey, Esq., Knight of
the Bath, Groom of the Bedchamber to
George the First, Auditor of the Exchequer,
and Clerk Comptroller of the Board of Green Cloth, by
whom she had a son, who died while a schoolboy at Westminster,
and a daughter married to Lord Dudley and Ward.
By her second husband, the Honourable William Feilding,
younger son of William, fifth Earl of Denbigh, and second
Earl of Desmond (whom she also survived), she left no
children. A marble tablet, surmounted by a bust, at Ashtead,
where she lies buried, bears this inscription: ‘Be this
monument sacred to the memory of Lady Diana Feilding,
daughter of Francis Newport, first Earl of Bradford. Her
first husband was grandson to the Earl of Berkshire. Surviving
her children, this illustrious branch of the house of Howard
became her family. To it during her life she assured the
inheritance of that estate she enjoyed by the bounty of her
first husband, and at her death she made provision still more
ample to support the honour and dignity of the present Earl
of Berkshire and his descendants. That his gratitude therefore
may be preserved in the minds of his latest posterity,
Henry Bowes, Earl of Berkshire, has caused this monument
to be erected, 1773.’ Lady Diana was very charitable to the
poor, and built and endowed alms-houses for six poor widows
in the neighbourhood of Leatherhead.</p>

SHE was the youngest daughter of Francis
William, son of William, Lord Russell of
Thornhaugh, County North Hants, who succeeded
his cousin Edward, as fourth Earl
of Bedford. Her mother was Catherine,
daughter and co-heir of Giles Bridges, Lord
Chandos. Lady Diana married Francis, Viscount Newport
(afterwards first Earl of Bradford), a distinguished loyalist,
and brave soldier in Charles the First’s army. He was taken
prisoner at Oswestry in 1644, at which time his wife (with
Lady D’Aubigny and others) also fell into the hands of the
rebels, as appears by a letter from the famous Hugh Peters
to the Earl of Stamford, soliciting the release of Lady
Newport. She died in 1694, and was interred at Chenies,
the burial-place of the Russell family in Buckinghamshire.</p>

HE was the second son of Orlando, first Earl of
Bradford (of the Bridgeman family), by Lucy
Elizabeth Byng, daughter of George, fourth
Viscount Torrington. He entered the Navy
in 1804 as first-class volunteer, on board
the <i>Repulse</i>, Captain the Honourable Arthur
Legge, under whom the following year he became Midshipman,
and was present at Sir Robert Calder’s action at the Passage
of the Dardanelles, and also in the Expedition of the Scheldt.
In 1809 he joined the <i>Manilla</i>, 36, Captain George Francis
Seymour (grandfather to the present Marquis of Hertford,
1885); in 1810 he was confirmed Lieutenant in the <i>Semiramis</i>,
both on the Lisbon station. He was subsequently appointed
Flag-Lieutenant to his old Commander, Rear-Admiral Legge,
under whose orders he had first sailed. Charles Bridgeman
was present at the defence of Cadiz, and joined successively
the <i>Bellerophon</i>, hoisting the flag of Sir Richard Keats, on the
Newfoundland station, and the <i>Royal Sovereign</i>, yacht, Captain
Sir John Poer Beresford. For two years he then commanded

BEGAN his education at a school at Parsons-green,
where he remained till he was
thirteen, and was then removed to the
Charterhouse, where he continued for two
or three years, and distinguished himself in
classics and other branches of learning.
He afterwards entered Christ Church College, Oxford, but his
father had early destined him for public life, and directed
Robert’s studies with a view to his future career, making a
point that political science, commerce, and finance should be
especially attended to. At college young Jenkinson became
the companion and friend of George Canning, afterwards
Prime Minister, a friendship which continued for a very long
period. Robert Jenkinson was at Paris on the breaking out
of the Revolution, and witnessed the demolition of the
Bastille by the mob: he was the means of affording useful
information to the British Government respecting the state of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>French public affairs, being in close correspondence with Mr.
Pitt. On his return to England he was chosen Member of
Parliament for Rye, under the especial patronage of the
Minister. But his election taking place twelve months before
his age qualified him to sit in the House of Commons, he
passed the intervening time in Paris. In 1791, on attaining
his twenty-first year, he took his seat, and made his first speech
in opposition to a motion of Mr. Whitbread’s on foreign
affairs, in which the young member showed a wonderful
acquaintance with European politics and international law.
Both he and his father were opposed to the Abolition of the
Slave-trade. When in 1792 Charles Fox moved an address
to the King to the effect that his Majesty should send an
Ambassador to the French Republic (Lord Gower having been
recalled), Mr. Jenkinson, in the absence of Mr. Pitt, replied
in indignant and eloquent terms: ‘On this very day, while we
are here debating about sending an Ambassador to Paris—on
this very day is the King of France to receive sentence; and
in all probability it is the day of his murder.’ And he proceeded
in glowing terms to point out how ill-advised, undignified,
and unfeeling the sanction which would thus be
given to ‘sanguinary monsters’ would appear in the sight of
all men. Fox’s motion was rejected without a division, and
Jenkinson’s eloquence gained him universal praise, Edmund
Burke being loud in his approbation. The young member
rose in the opinion of all parties from that moment, and
continued to take a prominent part as an upholder of the
Government, which course he pursued for several years.
In 1793 he was appointed one of the Commissioners of the
India Board: he invariably distinguished himself, especially
when speaking on matters connected with trade and commerce,
for which, Mr. Sheridan said, ‘Mr. Jenkinson might be
expected to have some claims to hereditary knowledge.’ In
1796 Robert’s father was created Earl of Liverpool, and he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>himself assumed the title of Lord Hawkesbury. He was a
staunch advocate for the union with Ireland, and in 1801 he
became Foreign Secretary, on the formation of a new
Ministry, which gave him ample scope for his knowledge of
political affairs on the Continent; and in the fulfilment of his
official duties, he gained new laurels on many occasions too
numerous to detail here. Later on, the management of the
House of Commons (as it is technically called) devolved upon
Lord Hawkesbury, who spoke on all the important questions
of the day, and, at the opening of the next session, was called
up to the House of Lords in order to strengthen the Ministry
in the Upper House. On the return of Mr. Pitt at the head
of the Ministry, he received the seals of the Home Department.
At a late period of this session, on Mr. Wilberforce
again bringing forward his favourite question of the Abolition
of the Slave-trade, Lord Hawkesbury was instrumental in
opposing the measure in the House of Lords, after it had
passed the Commons, a course which he also pursued with
regard to the Emancipation of the Roman Catholics of Ireland,
advocated by Lord Grenville. On the death of Mr. Pitt
in 1806, the King sent for Lord Hawkesbury to form a new
Ministry, an offer which he deemed it advisable to decline,
accepting, however, the office of Warden of the Cinque Ports.
He afterwards resumed his old post as Home Secretary,
and, his father dying in 1808, he succeeded to the Earldom
of Liverpool. He warmly advocated the cause of Spain,
and was selected to move the thanks of the House of Lords
to Lord Wellington for his gallantry in the Peninsula. After
the assassination of Mr. Perceval in 1812, Lord Liverpool
was prevailed upon, after frequent refusals, to accept the
office of Prime Minister, and during his long administration,
which lasted from 1812 to 1827, many of the questions of the
deepest importance connected with home and foreign politics
were brought under the notice of the Government. Lord
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>Liverpool never slackened in his attention to public affairs,
whatever difference of opinion may have existed then, or
subsequently as to the liberality of his opinions. The last
occasion on which Lord Liverpool was seen at his post was
on the 15th of February 1827, when he moved an address
expressing the willingness of the House to make an additional
provision for the Duke and Duchess of Clarence. On the
next day, after rising apparently in good health, and reading
his morning letters, he was found by his servant stretched
lifeless on the floor, and when the three most eminent
physicians of the day were called in, it was ascertained that
Lord Liverpool was suffering from an attack of an apoplectic
and paralytic nature. As soon as prudence allowed, he was
removed to his house at Combe Wood, where he gradually
declined, both in mental and bodily power, and expired, in
the presence of his wife, and his brother and successor, the
Honourable Charles Cecil Jenkinson, on the 4th of December
1828.</p>

<p class='c016'>Lord Liverpool was twice married: first, to Lady Louisa
Hervey, third daughter of the Bishop of Derry, fourth Earl of
Bristol, who died in 1821; and secondly, to Mary, daughter
of Charles Chester, Esq., formerly Bagot, brother of the first
Lord Bagot. He had no children by either marriage.</p>

HE was the eldest son of Edward, Lord Stanley,
afterwards thirteenth Earl of Derby
by Charlotte, second daughter of the Rev.
Geoffrey Hornby.</p>

<p class='c016'>The subject of this notice was educated
at Eton and Christ Church, Oxford, where
in 1819 he gained the Chancellor’s prize for Latin verse for
his poem of <i>Syracuse</i>. In 1821 he entered the House of
Commons as member for Stockbridge, and sat subsequently
for Preston, Windsor, and North Lancashire. He was Under-Secretary
for the Colonies from 1830 to 1833, Secretary of
State for the Colonies from 1833 to 1834, and again from
1841 to 1845. In 1844 he was summoned to the House of
Lords in his father’s barony of Stanley, and in 1859 was made
a K.G. He was First Lord of the Treasury in 1852, 1858,
and 1866. He was a strenuous opposer of Free-trade and the
Repeal of the Corn Laws, and his name is invariably connected
with ‘Protection.’ Lord Derby was remarkable as a statesman,
a scholar, a wit, and an orator. In the latter capacity
his enthusiasm and eloquence gained him the sobriquet of
‘the Rupert of Debate.’ In society his brilliant conversation,
keen sense of humour, and genial disposition, made him a
favourite with men and women of all classes and opinions, and
his death was as much deplored in private as in political
circles.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>He married, in 1825, Emma Caroline, second daughter of

HE was the youngest son of Henry, first Lord
Bradford, by the daughter and heir of the
Rev. John Simpson. He entered the Church,
and held successively the family livings of
Weston, and Wigan (in Lancashire), where
he died.</p>

<p class='c016'>In 1792 he married Lady Lucy Boyle, only daughter
<span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>of Edmund, seventh Earl of Cork and Orrery, by whom
he had two daughters and one son. Lady Lucy died in
1801, and in 1809 the widower married Charlotte Louisa,
daughter of William Poyntz, Esq. of Midgham, Berks, who
was first cousin to his first wife. This lady had no children,
and she died in 1840, at Hampton Court. Mr.
Bridgeman was a most amiable man and a most genial companion.
He was beloved in his own family, and among a
large circle of friends, by the servants of his household, the
poor in his parish, by children, horses, and dogs. Indeed, the
influence he exercised over animals was wonderful. In his
latter days he possessed a beautiful thoroughbred chestnut
mare, hot-tempered and violent by nature, who let no opportunity
slip of taking the bit between her teeth. The grooms,
until they became ‘up to her wicked ways,’ fought shy of
riding her, and the writer’s sister, a splendid and fearless
horsewoman, was very much mortified one day at finding she
could not hold ‘uncle George’s’ mare. Yet the moment Mr.
Bridgeman, then old and infirm, got into the saddle, the
generous beast became as quiet as a lamb, and her master
would often lay the reins on her beautiful neck, to show the
perfect understanding that subsisted between them. Added
to an earnest and by no means morose piety, the good pastor
possessed a vein of genial humour, and a genuine love of fun,
which was doubtless one of the qualities that endeared him to
the younger part of the community, and an anecdote is told
of him which is highly characteristic. One evening, dining
alone at a club in London, where he was little known, it was
impossible to avoid overhearing the conversation at a neighbouring
table, which, strangely enough, turned on his own son,
an officer of the Guards. The diners spoke of the pecuniary
difficulties into which he had lately been plunged, and while
they confessed his extravagance, they sang his praises—at
least he was not selfish, at least he spent his money on others,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>etc. etc.; no doubt about it, Bridgeman was a capital fellow,
the best fellow in the world, and many were the jolly parties they
had had at his expense. Now this was a sore subject at that
moment to the Rector of Wigan, but his sense of the ludicrous
triumphed over every other feeling, and, rising quietly,
he advanced towards the astonished group at the other table.
‘Gentlemen,’ he said, ‘I am very grateful for the handsome
terms in which you have spoken of my son, but will you allow
me to remark that it is I who am the best fellow in the world,
since it is I who have paid for all those dinners and suppers,
which I am delighted to think you have so much enjoyed.’</p>

by the daughter and heir of the Rev. John
Simpson of Babworth, County Notts. In

HE was the fifth son of Francis, Earl, afterwards
Marquis, of Hertford, by a daughter of the
Duke of Grafton. He entered the Royal
Navy while yet a boy, and justified his
parents’ choice of a profession for him,
never losing an opportunity of distinguishing
himself in the service he loved. His first cruise was on
board the <i>Pallas</i>, Captain the Honourable Leveson Gower.</p>

<p class='c016'>In 1785 he married Lady Horatia Waldegrave, daughter
of James, second Earl Waldegrave, with whose beautiful
features we are well acquainted in Sir Joshua Reynolds’
world-famed picture of ‘The Three Sisters,’ so long the glory
of Strawberry Hill. The union was very happy, only marred
by the separations which Lord Hugh’s profession entailed;
they had a family of five sons and three daughters. Seymour
gained post-rank early, and in 1794 did good service in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>command of the <i>Leviathan</i>, on the glorious 1st of June (Lord
Howe’s victory), when he was promoted to a colonelcy of
marines. Next year he attained flag-rank, and commanded
the <i>Spaniel</i>, under Lord Bridport, in that Admiral’s encounter
with the French fleet off the island of St. Croix. From 1795
to 1798 Lord Hugh had a seat at the Board of Admiralty,
after which he was appointed Commander-in-Chief of the Leeward
Islands, during which time the colony of Surinam surrendered
to the English combined naval and military forces
under Admiral Lord Hugh Seymour and General Trigge.
The Admiral’s eldest son, afterwards Admiral Sir George
Seymour, whose son succeeded to the Marquisate of Hertford,
was on board his father’s ship, but was invalided home in
1801, and on his arrival in England sad news awaited him.
His beloved mother was no more; while a fast sailing ship
brought the fatal tidings that a few days after his own departure,
Lord Hugh had died of yellow fever. Yet another blow
was in store for the poor young sailor, enfeebled by illness,
and nearly overwhelmed by this accumulation of sorrow, in
the loss of his favourite little brother, William, the pet of the
family. The tenderest care and most consummate skill were
needed to snatch George Seymour from the jaws of death.
But he lived to be an honour to his profession, and a blessing
to his family and friends. He inherited his mother’s beauty,
as those who remember him can testify. His countenance
was noble, his eyes large and brilliant, while even the wide
gash of a sabre cut, received in action, across the lips, was
powerless to mar the rare sweetness of his smile.</p>

RESPECTING this picture there has been more
than one controversy, and it has been not only
erroneously named in a catalogue of a
gallery at Madrid, but copied, doubtless
from thence, into the edition of engravings
of Vandyck’s portraits in the British Museum.
It has been miscalled Don Alonzo Perez de Guzman el Bueno
and his son. The late Lord Bradford, when in Madrid, saw
a replica of the picture in his possession, and made a note to
the effect that the portrait could not be that of the Spanish
nobleman in question, according to the date of Vandyck’s
death. His lordship identified it as that of Thomas, Earl of
Arundel and Surrey, and his grandson.</p>

<p class='c016'>Thomas was the only son of Philip, Earl of Arundel (who
died a prisoner in the Tower), by Anne, sister and co-heir of
Thomas, Lord Dacre of Gillesland. He was deprived, by his
father’s attainder, of the honours and greater part of the
estates of his family, and had only the title of Lord Maltravers
by courtesy during Queen Elizabeth’s reign, but was restored by
Act of Parliament in the first year of James the First (1603) to
all the titles and estates which his father had enjoyed before
his attainder, as also to the Earldom of Surrey, and to such
dignity of baronies as his grandfather, the Duke of Norfolk,
had also forfeited. He was, moreover, created Earl Marshal

IT has been well said of this beautiful and
exemplary woman, that she is even (like the
old Italian masters of painting) better
known to posterity by her sobriquet than
her name, for there were more than one
Lady Sunderland, but only one ‘Saccharissa.’
The poet, therefore, may lay better claim to the title of godfather
than the sponsors who held the infant Dorothy at the
font. She was the eldest of the eight daughters of Robert
Sidney, Earl of Leicester, of that name, by Dorothy, daughter
of Henry Percy, ninth Earl of Northumberland. Lord and
Lady Leicester bore a high character for ‘integrity and refinement
of breeding at the Court of Charles the First, while in
private life they shone a bright example of domestic harmony.’
Lady Leicester was a provident as well as a tender mother, and
she entertained early projects in the matter of an advantageous
marriage for her daughter, while Dorothy was still very
young. At sixteen the girl was renowned for her beauty, and
already surrounded by suitors. There appears to have been
a talk at Court of the probability of a match with my Lord
Russell, the heir of the house of Bedford; and Lady Leicester
writes from the country to her lord at Court, in 1635:</p>

<p class='c023'>‘It would
<span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>rejoice me much to receave some hope of that lord’s addresses
to Doll, that you writt of to me, for next to what consarns you,
I confess she is considered by me above any thing of this
world.’</p>

<p class='c022'>This marriage, however, was not to be, and there was
shortly after a talk of the Earl of Devonshire, which, by Lady
Leicester’s correspondence, appears to have had some let or
hindrance, through the interference of meddling interferers;
beside, she considered his mother and sister were ‘full of
decaite and jugling,’ professing to desire the union. The next
aspirant to the fair hand of the beautiful daughter of Penshurst
was no other than the celebrated Lord Lovelace, of whom her
mother thus writes: ‘I find my Lord Lovelace so uncertaine and
so idle, so much addicted to mean companie, and easily drawn
to debaucherie, it is now my studie to brake off with him.
Many particulars I could tell you of his wildnesse, but the
knowledge of them would be of no use to you, as he is likely
to be a stranger to us. For tho’ his estate is goode, his person
pretie enowfe, his witte much more than ordinarie, yet
dare I not venture to give Doll to him.’ Lady Leicester concludes
her letter to her husband by saying, ‘My deere hart,
let not these cross accidents trouble you, for we do not know
what God has provided for her.’</p>

<p class='c016'>The poet Waller now came forward and laid himself at the
feet of the high-born beauty; he had been left a widower
when quite young, and had gifts of nature and fortune to recommend
him, but Dorothy’s parents looked for noble birth
in a suitor for their daughter’s hand, and it is to be feared the
poor poet was dismissed with some disdain. He was not inconsolable,
however; he sought solace from his Muse, and,
better still, in his union shortly afterwards with a willing bride.</p>

<p class='c016'>A marriage was at length concluded ‘for dear Doll,’ which
was calculated to satisfy the best expectations of her parents,
and to ensure her own happiness.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>Henry, Lord Spencer of Wormleighton, the first-born son
of the second lord, by Penelope, daughter of Thomas
Wriothesley, Earl of Southampton, was born at Althorp, his
father’s country house, in 1620. To that father’s titles and
large estates the young man succeeded in 1636, and in 1639
he was married at Penshurst, Lord Leicester’s beautiful home
in Kent, to that nobleman’s eldest and most beloved daughter,
Lady Dorothy Sidney. Lord Leicester was at the time
Ambassador to the Court of France, and immediately after
the marriage the happy young couple hurried off to join the
bride’s father in Paris, where they remained for two years, that
is to say, until Lord Leicester’s diplomatic mission was at an
end. On their return, Lord Spencer took his seat in the
House of Lords, and soon made himself an object of esteem
and commendation by his talents and general good conduct.
These qualities, added to his high position and large property,
naturally made him an object worth contending for by the two
adverse parties that were now beginning to convulse England.
Lord Spencer had liberal views in the literal acceptation of
the word, and stoutly opposed many measures which he considered
arbitrary that emanated from the Throne; and the Parliament,
which was now beginning to assume the executive,
had great hopes of the young lord, and believed that they had
bound him to their side when he accepted the Lord-Lieutenancy
of his native county which they offered him. But Lord
Spencer came of a loyal stock, and there is little doubt he
cherished the hope of mediating between the King and his Parliament,
in which expectation he had many sharers amongst
the nobility and gentry of the land. He strove all he could to
be a ‘daysman’ between the two factions, but finding that his
admonitions to the Parliament when they broke out into open
rebellion were of no avail, he proclaimed himself stoutly for
the King; and in the early and blissful days of his married
life he tore himself from the embrace of his beautiful wife
<span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>and the calm happiness of his ancestral home, to mix in the
noise, turmoil, and danger of a camp, in company with his
kinsman and countyman, the gallant Spencer Compton, Earl
of Northampton, who was destined to fall at Hopton Heath.
Lord Spencer joined the King at York, and when the royal
standard was unfurled at Nottingham, he took the field as a
volunteer. In his constant letters to his ‘dearest harte,’ he
gives a melancholy picture of the perplexed and unsatisfactory
state of affairs in the royal army. He says: ‘The discontent
that I and other honest men receive dayly is beyond expression,’
and he declares ‘that were it not for the punctilio of
honour’ he would not ‘remaine an howre.’</p>

<p class='c016'>Lord Spencer was with the King at Edgehill, and with
Prince Rupert at Bristol, etc. etc., and in 1643 he was raised
to the dignity of Earl of Sunderland. He writes a long and
most loving letter to his sweetest Doll from before Gloucester,
and thanks her for her letters, ‘writing to you and hearing from
you being the most pleasant entertainment I am capable of
receiving in anie place, but especially here, where, but when I
am in the trenches (which are seldom without my company),
I am more solitarie than ever I was in mie life.’ In another
letter written from Oxford in September 1643, he thus speaks
of his little daughter: ‘Pray bless Popet for me, and tell her
I would have writt to her, but on deliberation I deem it
uncivil to return an answer to a ladie in anie other characters
but her own, and that I am not learned enough to do.’ Alas!
the brave soldier was never more destined to enjoy his wife’s
dear company, or clasp his sweet Popet to his heart. Four
days after that letter was penned, the writer was struck down
by a cannon ball on the field of Newbury, in company with his
friend and brother in arms, ‘the incomparable Falkland,’ and
many other brave and loyal spirits. For twelve months
Lord Sunderland had fought beside the King, as a volunteer,
for he never would accept a commission. There is a most
<span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>touching letter extant from Lord Leicester to his widowed
daughter, which our limited space alone prevents our inserting
here. The fair hopes contained in her old admirer Waller’s
letter, written at the time of her marriage, to her sister, Lady
Lucy Sidney, were far from being fulfilled. After wishing the
couple every happiness, he says, ‘May her lord not mourn her
long, but go hand in hand with her to that place where is
neither marrying nor giving in marriage, but being divorced, we
may all have an equal interest in her.’ There spoke the disappointed
and jealous lover. Lady Sunderland was with child
of a daughter at the period of her lord’s untimely death, who
scarcely survived its birth. She retired to her husband’s estate
in Northamptonshire, where she made herself generally beloved.
‘She is not to be mentioned,’ says Lloyd in his Memoirs of the
Loyalists, ‘without the highest honour, in the catalogue of
sufferers, to so many of whom her house was a sanctuary, her
interest a protection, her estate a maintenance.’ Influenced,
it is said, by her father’s wishes, she contracted a second marriage
in 1652 to Sir Robert Smythe, of the family of the Lords
Strangford, a gentleman of Kent, but was again left a widow;
she survived Sir Robert some time, and, we are told, she continued
to see her old flame Waller, to whom she one day put
the dangerous question—‘Pray, Master Waller, when will you
write such pretty verses to me again?’ Was it the sting of old
mortification which prompted the cruel answer, ‘When your
ladyship is young and beautiful again’? By her first husband
Lady Sunderland had two children, Robert, the second Earl,—the
Minister of whom the anecdote is told that when Addison
intrusted Edmund Smith with the task of writing a history of
the Revolution of 1688, the proposed author asked the staggering
question, ‘What shall I do with the character of Lord
Sunderland?’ and a daughter, Dorothy, who married Sir George
Saville, afterwards Marquis of Halifax. By her second husband
she had an only child, Robert, Governor of Dover Castle. Lady
<span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>Sunderland lies buried by the side of her dearly loved Henry in
a beautiful monument, in the Spencer chapel, in the church of
Brington, hard by Althorp House, and in that house her name
is still a household word; and Saccharissa’s bed, the curtains
of which, having her embroidered monogram of S twisting
round columns, may still be seen in one of the principal
guest-chambers.</p>

THE second but eldest surviving son of Sir
John Seymour, of Wulfhall, County Wilts,
by Margaret, daughter of Sir John Wentworth
of Nettlested, County Suffolk. He
was educated at Oxford and Cambridge, and
joining his father, who was in high favour at
Court, entered the army, distinguished himself in France, and
was knighted for his services in 1525. On his return to
England he was appointed Esquire to the King, and was one
of the challengers in the tilt-yard at Greenwich, when Henry
the Eighth kept his Christmas there.</p>

<p class='c016'>On the King’s marriage with his sister, Jane Seymour,
Edward was created Viscount Beauchamp, and in 1537 Earl of
Hertford. He was then sent to France on a mission, and was
created Knight Companion of the Garter, at Hampton Court,
on his return. From this time his life became most eventful.
He proceeded twice to Scotland, high in command, and again
to France, where he was instrumental in concluding a peace
with that country. Honours and distinctions too many to
enumerate were heaped on the King’s brother-in-law, even
after the death of poor Queen Jane. He was one of the
many executors of Henry the Eighth, by whose will he was
appointed guardian to the young King, and so prompt were
his measures and so successful his ambitious and self-seeking
<span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>policy that when the nephew was proclaimed King in London,
the uncle was appointed Protector of the realm. He already
bore the titles of Earl and Viscount, and Edward the Sixth,
not content with adding the title of Baron, bestowed a ducal
coronet upon him, in order that the name of that family, ‘from
which our most beloved mother Jane, late Queen of England,
drew her beginning, might not be clouded by any higher title
or colour of dignity.’ Thus ran the words of the patent.
When the Duke of Norfolk was attainted, the Protector was
made Earl Marshal for life. His power now became almost
absolute, and the boy King, delighted to do his uncle honour,
elected that he should sit on the right hand of the throne.
Indeed Somerset was now king in all but name, and his
enemies, of whom there were many, accused him of aspiring
to the Crown in good earnest. It was alleged against him
that he used the royal pronoun ‘we,’ and signed himself
‘Protector by the grace of God.’ But the life of Protector
Somerset belongs to the chronicles of the history of England.
Numerous factions rose up against him, at the head of which
were the Earl of Warwick, his sworn enemy, and his own
ungrateful brother, Thomas, Lord Seymour of Sudley. Many
charges were brought against him; he was deprived of all his
high offices, and imprisoned in the Tower. The young King,
who loved him dearly, had little power to befriend his uncle,
whose estates were forfeited, and he was treated with insult
and contumely. The Earl of Warwick was bent on his
destruction. Arraigned of high treason at Westminster Hall,
he demanded a trial of his peers, was acquitted of the principal
charge, but found guilty of felony, and after several months’
imprisonment, in spite of every attempt on King Edward’s
part, Edward Seymour, Duke of Somerset, was condemned to
die on the scaffold. On reaching the platform, he kneeled in
prayer, and afterwards addressed the people, with the majority
of whom he was a great favourite, in calm and measured
<span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>terms, declaring his innocence, his loyalty to the King, and
his love of his native country. A tumult took place among
the people, and a horseman appearing suddenly in the crowd,
a cry was raised of ‘A pardon! a pardon!’ But all the
time his arch-enemy, Lord Warwick (or rather Northumberland,
as he then was), stood by untouched, shaking his cap and
making signs to the people to be quiet. We have not space
to make extracts from a dying speech, which for manliness,
forbearance, and piety could scarcely be surpassed. The
Duke, unbuckling his sword, presented it to the Lieutenant
of the Tower, gave the executioner money, bade all near him
farewell, and then kneeling down, arranged his collar and
covered his face, which showed ‘no signs of trouble,’ with his
handkerchief. Laying his head upon the block, he called out
thrice ‘Lord Jesu, save me,’ and then received the death-stroke.</p>

<p class='c016'>Edward, first Duke of Somerset, was twice married. First,
to Catherine, daughter and co-heir of Sir William Fillol, of
Woodlands, County Dorset, respecting whom there exists a
mystery and rumours of misconduct. Certain it is that her
son was disinherited. There seems little doubt, at all events,
that the Duke’s second wife, the daughter of Sir Edward
Stanhope, of Bampton, County Dorset, an ambitious and
violent woman, worked on her husband’s mind, to the detriment
of her predecessor’s children, in spite of which the
coveted titles devolved after some generations on Catherine
Fillol’s descendants, ancestors in direct line to the present
Duke of Somerset.</p>

</div><p class='drop-capi1_1'>
THE eldest son of a merchant in Antwerp
(himself a painter in glass), by one Maria
Cuypero. Little Anthony’s mother was a
skilful artist in embroidery, and encouraged
her boy’s taste for drawing, in the rudiments
of which he received instruction from his
father. When only ten years of age he became the pupil of
Hendrik van Balen, a much-esteemed painter, who had studied
in Italy; but young Vandyck had set his heart on entering the
studio of his famous fellow-citizen, Peter Paul Rubens, and
that desire was fulfilled. His remarkable talent and untiring
industry made him a favourite both of master and scholars,
when an incident happened which brought him into prominent
notice. It chanced one afternoon, when Rubens was absent,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>that the scholars invaded the sanctity of the private studio,
and, in the exuberance of animal spirits, indulged in what in
modern parlance is called ‘bear-fighting.’ An unfinished
Holy Family stood on an easel, the colours not yet dry, and,
in the course of the rough play, one of his companions pushed
Van Diepenbeke so heavily against the precious canvas that
the arm of the Magdalen and the head of the Virgin were
nearly effaced, and all the colours smudged. The general
consternation may easily be conceived. A council was held,
and a general decision arrived at that the most skilful among
the students should endeavour to repair the mischief. Unanimous
choice fell on Vandyck, who began to work in right
earnest, for there was not a moment to lose. There were but
a few hours of daylight left him, but he accomplished his task
before nightfall. Early next morning the dreaded moment
arrived. Rubens entered his studio in order to examine the
work of the preceding evening, when he pronounced the
memorable words which seemed to bestow a diploma on his
young disciple: ‘Why, this looks better than it did yesterday!’
Then, approaching nearer, he detected the traces of a
strange hand. Investigation and explanation followed, and
Vandyck came in for great praise from the lips of his beloved
master. Rubens was most desirous that his talented pupil
should proceed to Italy to study the works of the great
masters, but in the meantime the young man had received an
invitation to England. The first visit he paid to our country
was short and unsatisfactory, and there are so many discrepancies
in the accounts of the work he did at that period
and his reasons for leaving England somewhat abruptly, that
we refrain from entering further on the subject. From England
Vandyck proceeded to the Hague, where he painted
portraits of every class and denomination of person, commencing
with the Court and family of the Stadtholder, Henry
Frederick. Nobles, warriors, statesmen, burghers, all vied for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>the honour of sitting to him. The news of his father’s illness
recalled him to Antwerp. He arrived just in time to receive
that father’s blessing, and listen to his last injunctions, which
included an order to paint an altar for the Chapel of the
Dominican Sisters, who had nursed him tenderly in his illness.
After many delays from various causes Vandyck arrived in
Venice, where he studied Titian and Veronese, and afterwards
proceeded to Genoa, where he became the favourite of
the proudest nobles of that proud city, and adorned almost
every palace therein with splendid portraits. At Rome he
remained some years; the first order he received being that of
the world-renowned portrait of Cardinal Bentivoglio, which
attracted a crowd of sitters to his studio, including all the
nobility of the city and most of the foreign visitors. He then
made his way to Florence and most of the northern cities of
Italy, with a flying visit to Sicily, whence he was driven by
the outbreak of the plague. He returned to Antwerp, where he
at first shared the proverbial fate of the prophet in his own
country, and met with much ill-will and small patronage, until
his old friend Rubens came to his rescue by buying every
completed picture in his late scholar’s studio, and recommending
and befriending him on every occasion. Shortly
afterwards Rubens departed from Antwerp on a diplomatic
mission, and he left Vandyck undisputed master of the field.
His hands were now full; he received endless commissions
both in portraits and sacred subjects. He afterwards went to
Paris, and paid two visits to England; the second time he
was received at Court with every mark of distinction. Charles
the First treated the noble Fleming as a personal friend,
taking the greatest delight in his society. He became the
centre of attraction, and the cynosure of all eyes. Pre-eminently
handsome, brilliant in conversation, a good linguist,
an enlightened traveller—even without the crowning quality of
his splendid talent, the painter became a shining light in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>refined and aristocratic circles of the English capital. The
King bestowed the honour of knighthood on him, and presented
him with a valuable miniature of himself set in diamonds.
Both their Majesties sat constantly for their portraits,
and it is needless to observe that every country house in England
is enriched by treasures from the brush of Vandyck. The
King and the Duke of Buckingham were busy in arranging a
suitable match for their friend and favourite. The lady
selected was Mary Ruthven, a member of the Queen’s household,
and grand-daughter of the unfortunate Earl Gowrie,
much esteemed for her goodness and beauty, who visited
Antwerp with her husband shortly after their marriage, where
they were received with every mark of respect and distinction.
After this they went to Paris, where Vandyck met with disappointment,
and fell into bad health, and on his return to
England he found that country in a state of confusion and
political strife, his royal and private friends involved in trouble
and perplexity, the King and Queen both absent from London,
and the Parliament in arms against the Crown. Sir Anthony’s
health declined, both physically and morally. He gave himself
up to the pursuit of alchemy, and would stand for hours over a
hot fire in the vain hope of obtaining the philosopher’s stone;
He grew haggard and wrinkled while still in the prime of life.
The King, returning to London, and hearing of his friend’s
illness, sent his own physician, but all human aid was unavailing.
A severe attack of gout, combined with other maladies,
proved fatal, and on the 9th of December 1641, the man who
by many has been considered the chief of the world’s portrait
painters breathed his last. Followed by a large retinue of
friends, he was buried in St. Paul’s Cathedral, leaving a most
exemplary will, in which wife, child, sister, servants, were all
remembered, as also the poor in two parishes. He left an
only daughter, Justiniana, who married Sir John Stepney
of Prendergast, Pembroke, and afterwards Martin de Carbonnell.

</div><p class='drop-capi1_1'>
THE Carews came of an ancient family in
Devonshire, but the branch to which Sir
Nicholas belonged had settled at Beddington,
in Surrey, an estate that had come into
their possession by marriage.</p>

<p class='c016'>Nicholas was the eldest son of Sir Richard
Carew, Knight-Banneret, by Magdalen, daughter of Sir Thomas
Oxenbridge, Bart., of Ford, in Sussex. When Sir Richard died,
and his son succeeded, the landed property was very extensive,
and it was said the owner might start from his own house, and
ride in any direction straight on end for ten miles at least on his
own land. When still a youth Nicholas went to Paris, where,
we are told, he became so enamoured of French manners,
customs, and fashions, that on his return to England he could
<span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>speak and boast of nothing else. Handsome, well-born, and
accomplished, he soon attracted the notice of Henry the
Eighth, who welcomed him at Court, and appointed him a
Gentleman of the Privy Chamber, a place which was then of
much higher standing than in later days. But Carew did not
make himself popular in the royal household. The constant
comparisons which he daily drew between the French and
English Courts, to the great disparagement of the latter,
offended his colleagues in the highest degree, and were not
calculated to gratify the King. Henry resolved to give the
young man a lesson. If he were so devoted to France, to
France he should go, and that without delay. At the same
time, unwilling to dismiss him without some ostensible reason,
he appointed Sir Nicholas governor of a fortress in Picardy,
which was in the hands of the English. A castle in a provincial
town did not offer the charms which Carew had found in
the splendid capital of France, and it may easily be believed
the office did not suit his taste. He doubtless petitioned
the King; at all events, he was recalled, forgiven, and taken
back into favour. He now became Henry’s almost inseparable
companion, and was foremost in all the jousts, tournaments,
maskings, and all kinds of Court revelry, in which they both
excelled and delighted. Carew was, moreover, appointed
Master of the Horse, at that period one of the highest offices
in the realm, and Knight of the Garter.</p>

<p class='c016'>The favour of Henry the Eighth was as easily lost as won,
and Fuller tells us that a tradition in the family reported that
Carew’s downfall proceeded, in the first instance, from a
quarrel between him and his master at bowls, ‘when his Grace,
who was no good fellow, and would always rather give than
take in repartee,’ so exasperated his Master of the Horse,
‘that his answer was rather true than discreet, consulting his
own animosity rather than his allegiance, whereat the King
was so offended that Sir Nicholas fell from the top of his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>favour to the bottom of his displeasure, and was bruised to
death.’ ‘This’—we quote Fuller all the time—‘was the true
cause of his execution. He was charged with high treason, as
accomplice with the Marquis of Exeter, Lord Montague, Sir
Edward Neville, and others, in a plot to depose King Henry
the Eighth, and place Cardinal Pole on the throne. They
were all found guilty, and sentenced to death, with the exception
of the Cardinal’s brother, who saved his own life by
betraying his confederates. The evidence against Sir Nicholas
appears to have been slight, but he was out of favour, and
everything was turned to his prejudice. He was beheaded
on Tower Hill in 1539.’ Holinshed said ‘he made a godly
confession of his fault, and his superstitious faith.’ He was a
Roman Catholic. Sir Nicholas Carew married Elizabeth,
daughter and afterwards sole heir of Sir Thomas Bryan,
Master of Common Pleas, by whom he had one son and
three or four daughters.</p>

<p class='c016'>The son, Sir Francis Carew, never married, but having
regained a considerable portion of the estates forfeited on his
father’s attainder, during the reign of Elizabeth, he bequeathed
his property to his sister’s son, Sir Nicholas Throckmorton, on
condition that he assumed the name and arms of Carew.</p>

SON of Sir Everard Digby, born at Gothurst
or Gayhurst, County Bucks, the property of
his mother, daughter and sole heir of Sir
William Mulsho. He was but a child when
his father suffered death as one of the conspirators
in the Gunpowder Plot. The
Crown laid claim to the estates and revenues of the family;
but the widowed Lady Digby, a woman of great energy and
determination, not only saved her own dower by her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>strenuous efforts, but rescued a few hundreds for her son out of
the wreck, and, although a rigid Roman Catholic, she suffered
her boy to be educated as a Protestant from prudential
motives. The romance of the loves of Kenelm Digby and
Venetia Stanley, which made such a noise at the time, and
has been the subject of curiosity and controversy ever since,
whenever their names are mentioned, began at a very early
age. Sir Edward Stanley, of the noble house of Derby, lived
at Tong Castle, County Salop. He married the daughter and
co-heir of the Earl of Northumberland, who brought him two
daughters, ‘the divine Venetia’ being the youngest. Her
mother died when she was a few months old. The widower
gave himself up to grief, shunned the world, and could not
even derive comfort from the society of his children. He
sent them therefore (or at all events Venetia) to the care of a
relative, who was a neighbour of Lady Digby’s. Thus began
the acquaintance, and Sir Edward’s beautiful little girl and
Lady Digby’s lovely boy met constantly, and played at love-making,
jealousy, rivalry, coquetry, quarrels, reconciliations,—in
fact a perfect rehearsal of all the drama that was to be
enacted in good earnest a few years later. The marriage of
the Princess Elizabeth with the Elector Palatine, afterwards
King of Bohemia, called Sir Edward to London. With a
violent wrench he tore himself away from his seclusion, and
sending for Venetia carried her with him to the Court of King
James, then the scene of great festivity.</p>

<p class='c016'>In all these gaieties, according to Digby’s account, the
juvenile beauty took part, and was the centre of admiration.
In the meantime her young lover pursued his studies under
the care of Laud, Dean of Gloucester, subsequently Archbishop
of Canterbury, and afterwards with Dr. Thomas Allen,
an eminent scholar, at Oxford.</p>

<p class='c016'>Digby distinguished himself at the University, where he
remained two years, but whenever he returned home for the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>vacation, the flirtation with his fair neighbour was resumed.
He wrote a strange and wild romance respecting her, in
which it is impossible to disentangle truth from fiction, but
some of the adventures are too marvellous for belief, and the
whole narrative is disagreeable, and tedious into the bargain.</p>

<p class='c016'>His jealousy seems to have been excited by a certain
courtier, whose suit, he affirms, was favoured by Venetia’s
governess. Lady Digby was too wise a mother to smile on
such a precocious courtship, even if she disbelieved the reports
which had already begun to circulate, detrimental to
Mistress Stanley’s reputation.</p>

<p class='c016'>She despatched her son on foreign travel, but before his
departure the lovers had met and plighted their troth. According
to the traveller’s own account, he made a conquest of the
French Queen when in Paris <i>en route</i> for Italy.</p>

<p class='c016'>A report of his death having been accidentally or purposely
circulated, Venetia’s conduct on the occasion was differently
represented to her absent lover, some declaring she was inconsolable,
others that she lent a willing ear to the suit of the
very same courtier who had before excited Kenelm’s jealousy.</p>

<p class='c016'>Nothing can be more bombastic and high-flown than the
language in which he describes the fluctuations of his passion
for Venetia, his implicit trust in her constancy in one page,
his doubts and suspicions in another.</p>

<p class='c016'>It seems more than probable that the prudent Lady Digby
intercepted her son’s love-letters, and did all in her power to
prevent a marriage she thought most undesirable, and she
was doubtless delighted when Kenelm accompanied his kinsman,
Lord Bristol, to Spain, where he was then negotiating
the Prince of Wales’s marriage with the Infanta at Madrid.
Kenelm became himself attached to the Prince’s suite, and
took an active part in diplomatic transactions.</p>

<p class='c016'>In this land of romance it may well be imagined that the
handsome and accomplished Englishman ran the gauntlet of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>many adventures among the dark-eyed daughters of the South,
nor does he omit to allude to innumerable conquests; indeed,
he went so far as to have a portrait of himself painted with
an effigy of one of his victims in the background, yet he
incessantly boasted of his constancy to the absent loved one.
On his return to England with the Prince of Wales, he was
knighted by the King at Hinchingbrook, and immediately
flew to his lady-love in spite of maternal prohibition. Then
followed recriminations, explanations, trials of her faith and
virtue, challenges, duels—a stormy suit, indeed, according to
his own testimony.</p>

<p class='c016'>Respecting the date of their marriage there is great
difference of opinion. At all events, Kenelm insisted on its
being kept secret, nor was poor Venetia allowed to announce
it, even when a fall from her horse brought on a premature
confinement, which nearly cost her her life.</p>

<p class='c016'>King James admired Sir Kenelm for his great erudition,
and complimented him on his essays on Sympathetic Powder,
Alchemy, and other subjects bordering on the supernatural.
On the accession of Charles the First, Sir Kenelm Digby was
made Gentleman of the Privy Chamber, Commissioner of the
Navy, and Governor of the Trinity House, shortly after which,
he was appointed to the command of a naval squadron, sent
to the Mediterranean against the Venetian fleet and the
Algerine pirates.</p>

<p class='c016'>In this voyage he was eminently successful, bringing the
Venetians to terms, chastising the pirates, and releasing a
large number of English slaves. It is said that on the eve of
his embarkation, a second son being born to him, he had
permitted his wife to declare their marriage, and had consigned
her to the care of his kinsman, Lord Bristol, during
his absence from England. About this time, his faithful
old friend, Thomas Allen, bequeathed to him a splendid
library, which he made over to the Bodleian.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>In 1633, after his return, his beautiful but far from happy
wife died, and the mystery which had shrouded Venetia’s
whole life hung like a dark cloud over her death, and reports
of all kinds were current.</p>

<p class='c016'>There is no doubt that Sir Kenelm had been in the habit of
making chemical and alchemical experiments on Venetia for
some time past, and the tradition of the concoction of snails
which he had invented as a preservative of her naturally brilliant
complexion is still extant at Gayhurst, where it is said the
somewhat rare breed of large ‘Pomatia’ is still to be found.</p>

<p class='c016'>By Digby’s desire his wife’s head (‘which contained but
little brain’) was opened, and he decided that she had taken
an overdose of viper wine. But spiteful women declared she
had fallen a victim to a viper husband’s jealousy, though
Aubrey, who tells sad tales of Venetia before her marriage,
says she was a blameless wife.</p>

<p class='c016'>There is more than one portrait of her, with allegorical
emblems of Innocence, Slander, and the like. Her name had
often been coupled with that of the Earl of Dorset, and some
said he had settled an annuity on her, which was paid up to
the time of her death. Be this as it may, Sir Kenelm and
Lady Digby always dined once a year with my Lord Dorset,
who received them courteously but formally, only permitting
himself to kiss the beauty’s hand with great respect.</p>

<p class='c016'>Venetia was buried in a church near Newgate, in a tomb
of black marble, with long inscriptions, surmounted by a
copper-gilt bust, all destroyed in the great fire. Numerous
epitaphs were written in her honour. Ben Jonson calls her
‘A tender mother, a discreet wife, a solemn mistress, a good
friend, so lovely and charitable in all her petite actions, so
devote in her whole life,’ etc.</p>

<p class='c016'>Whatever Sir Kenelm’s real feelings were, his outward grief
was extreme. He retired to Gresham College, lived like a
hermit, studied chemistry, wore a long mourning cloak, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>left his beard unshorn. Although it was generally supposed
that his secession from the Protestant faith took place when
he was in Spain, it was not until 1653 that he wrote to his
friend Laud (whose admirable answer is extant) to announce
the fact. He was a firm adherent of Charles <span class='fss'>I.</span>, and greatly
esteemed by Henrietta Maria; but his loyalty got him into
trouble with the Parliament, and he was exiled to France.
Returning in a few months he was imprisoned in 1640 for
nearly three years, and was supposed only to have regained
his liberty through the intercession of the French Queen, who
had loved him twenty years before. His release, however,
was conditional. He was forbidden to take part in any
public affairs, and he therefore gave himself up to literary and
scientific pursuits, and engaged in a polemical correspondence
with his quondam tutor, Laud, whom he is said to have
tempted to change his faith, by the bait of a Cardinal’s Hat.
Sir Kenelm returned to France and frequented the Court of
his old flame, the Queen Dowager, where his noble appearance,
almost gigantic size, his handsome features, agreeable
conversation and manners, his learning, and last, but perhaps
not least, his predilection for the occult sciences, made him
an universal favourite. On the death of his eldest son, killed
on the Royalist side at the battle of St. Neot’s, Sir Kenelm
returned to compound for his estates, but was not suffered to
remain in England. He went back to Paris, where Henrietta
Maria made him her Chancellor; and he was then intrusted
with a mission to Pope Innocent <span class='fss'>X.</span>, who welcomed him at
first, but after a time the ‘Englishman grew high, and hectored
at His Holiness, and gave him the lie.’</p>

<p class='c016'>Once more in England, after the dissolution of the Long
Parliament, Cromwell took him into his confidence, hoping by
his mediation to gain over the Roman Catholics.</p>

<p class='c016'>His conduct in these circumstances has been praised by
some and censured by others, as may well be imagined, according
<span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>to religious and political bias. He travelled through
France, Lower Germany, and the Palatinate, always seeking
and being sought by men of letters; and 1660 saw him once
more back in his native land.</p>

<p class='c016'>Charles <span class='fss'>II.</span> showed him but little favour. He was nominated
F.R.S., and resided (1663) in a fair house in Covent
Garden, where he had a laboratory. ‘Philosopher, theologian,
courtier, soldier; polite, amiable, handsome, graceful.’ Lord
Clarendon’s testimony is, ‘eccentric, vain, unstable in religion,
a duellist.’ These are the counterbalancing portraits of Sir
Kenelm Digby. He desired to be buried near Venetia. His
epitaph was as follows:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c018'>

    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Under this tomb the matchless Digby lies,</div>

HE was the younger son of Sir Robert Killigrew
of Hanworth, County Middlesex, by
Mary, daughter of Sir Henry Wodehouse,
who married, secondly, Sir Thomas Stafford.
Thomas, or as he was usually called, Tom
Killigrew, was early initiated into the
mysteries of Court life, being appointed Page of Honour to
King Charles the First, to whom he remained faithful, and
followed Charles the Second and his mother in their exile.
About the year 1651 the King sent him in a diplomatic
capacity to Venice, where Killigrew seems to have disported
himself to his heart’s content, and it was evidently here that
he imbibed that passion for music and the drama, which never
forsook him, but which converted him into a dramatist and a
theatrical <i>entrepreneur</i>, rather, we should say, confirmed him
in these tastes which were already developed in his boyhood;
for we have an anecdote of his school days, how he would go
to the Red Bull Tavern, not far from the theatre, during the
performance, and how, more than once, the waiter came in
crying, ‘Who will go and be a devil on the stage, and he shall
see the play for nothing?’ an offer with which young Tom
gladly closed. Thus began his career; for was not he a merry
devil the chief part of his life?</p>

<p class='c016'>Venice, as we have seen, suited his humour well, and
Thomas was evidently one of those foreigners who go on the
principle of howling with the wolves, and doing at Rome more
<span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>than the Romans do. In fact, he was so carried away by the
vivacity of the Venetians, the maskings, flirtings, and what
not, which he encountered in the fair city of the sea, that
Thomas began to out-Herod Herod, and lived his life at such
a rate as to scandalise the Venetian authorities, who directed
their ambassador at Paris to wait on the English King, and
urge the recall of his envoy. Charles complied, but it was not
likely that the peccadilloes of which ‘Tommaso’ had been
guilty should appear unpardonable in the eyes of the merry
monarch, and he received the delinquent into especial favour,
and on the Restoration Tom became Groom of the Bedchamber,
and the King’s inseparable companion. Pepys, in
his diary of 1660, about the time of Charles’s return to his
dominions, records his meeting with Tom, when being on my
Lord Sandwich’s ship, he met, ‘with other fine company, Tom
Killigrew, a merry droll, but a gentleman, full of wit and
humour, a general favourite, especially with the King. And I
walked with him for some time on the deck, and he told most
amusing stories.’</p>

<p class='c016'>Killigrew had not been long in England before he put
a darling scheme into execution, namely, to bring over an
Italian troop of actors from Venice to perform in singing
and recitative. He had by this time set up as a dramatic
author, and was instrumental in introducing into England the
fashion of female performers, for, until the Restoration, actresses
had not appeared on the stage, although in Italy, Spain, and
elsewhere, the female characters were always represented by
women. It may easily be believed that this innovation fell in
with the royal taste, and there was great amusement afforded
by a representation of the Parson’s Wedding, a comedy of
Master Killigrew’s own writing, entirely performed by females.
In another portion of his diary Pepys relates how he met Tom
at my Lord Brouncker’s one night in company with a certain
musician, one Signor Baptista, and Killigrew told us how they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>proposed to give an opera entirely in the Italian language, and
he goes on to say that Baptista was singer, poet, and all in
one, and that he sang them one of the acts, and that from the
words alone, without any music prickt, which seemed to
astonish good Master Samuel, who makes some of his accustomed
sapient remarks on the occasion: ‘I did not understand
the words, and so do not know if they are fitted, but I
perceive there is a proper accent in every country’s discourse,
but I am not as much smitten by it as if I were acquainted
with the language.’</p>

<p class='c016'>Good Master Pepys had made a discovery in those early
times, which we recommend to the notice of many who pass in
these days for proficients in the vocal line. The newly-born
Italian opera now became the rage, very often, indeed, to the
detriment of the English theatrical companies, so much so
that sometimes Killigrew’s own dramatic productions were
played to empty benches. Besides Signor Baptista there was
another eminent musician, Francesco Corbetta, who not only
sang in opera, but gave lessons in singing and the guitar, an
instrument hitherto almost unknown in this country.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c018'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Famossissimo maestro, di ghitarra,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Qual Orfeo in suonar, ognun il narra!’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c022'>Guitar-playing became a perfect mania among the fine
ladies and gentlemen at Court, ‘the King’s relish for that
instrument,’ says De Grammont, ‘helping to bring it into
vogue, and the guitar (whether for show or use) was now as
necessary an appendage to a lady’s toilet-table as her rouge or
patch-box. In fact, there was a universal strumming of the
whole <i>guitarrery</i> at Court.’ Lord Arran, a younger son of the
Duke of Ormonde, and his sister were amongst the greatest
proficients; indeed, Lady Chesterfield was as much admired
for her musical talent as for her undoubted beauty, and it was
whispered her lord was very jealous of the Duke of York’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>evident appreciation of both these attractions. Tom Killigrew’s
popularity with the King increased daily, and there was a
report that his Majesty intended to revive the disused office of
Court Jester in the person of his favourite. We believe such
an <i>officer</i> had been attached to his father’s household, but the
post could only have been nominal. An old writer thus
describes the duties of a Court Jester, ‘A witty and jocose
person kept by princes, to inform them of their faults, and those
of other people.’ We scarcely give Charles the Second credit
for such a motive in his election. Pepys alludes to the
circumstance in these words, ‘Tom Killigrew has a fee out of
the Wardrobe for Cap and Bells as King’s Jester, and may
tease and rule anybody, the greatest person, without offence,
in privilege of his place.’ Of this privilege Tom took advantage,
sometimes in a good cause, for with all their faults and
failings, both he and his kindred spirit, Nell Gwynne, regretted
the bad odour into which Charles had fallen through his
neglect of public affairs, and Nell often admonished her royal
lover on the subject. One day the two friends hatched a
small plot. Says Nelly, ‘I have been just listening to the complaints
of one of the Court Lords, of Charles’s neglect of all
duty, and how that he has quite forgotten the existence of
such a thing as a Cabinet Council, upon which I bet his Lordship
£100 that the King should attend the very next. He
sneered, but accepted the wager.’ Now we do not know if
Nelly promised her accomplice to go halves, but we do know
that that evening, when the King was in Madam Gwynne’s
apartments, the door flew open, and in burst Tom, disguised
as a pilgrim. The King swore at him, and asked if he had
not heard the royal command that he should not be disturbed.
‘Oh yes, sire,’ was the reply, ‘but I was obliged to come and
take leave of your Majesty before my departure.’</p>

<p class='c016'>‘Why, where the —— are you going, and what does this
absurd masquerading mean?’</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>‘I am starting this very moment for hell.’</p>

<p class='c016'>‘Already,’ sneered the King, ‘and on what errand?’</p>

<p class='c016'>‘To beg and pray of the devil to lend me Oliver Cromwell,
if for ever so short a time, to attend to the affairs of the
country, as his successor spends all his time in pleasure.’</p>

<p class='c016'>The Jester was forgiven, and Nelly won her wager.</p>

<p class='c016'>Another time Charles taxed his fool with telling everybody
that the King was suffering from torturing pains in the nose,
and asked the meaning of such a senseless report. ‘I crave
your Majesty’s pardon,’ says Tom, ‘I knew you had been led
by the nose for so many years, that I felt sure it must have
become tender and painful.’</p>

<p class='c016'>But the Jester occasionally carried the jest too far; there
was a play called ‘The Silent Woman,’ given in London about
this time, wherein appeared the character of Tom Otter, a
henpecked husband, a reputation which the Duke of York
enjoyed at Court. One night Charles said, ‘I will go no more
abroad with Tom Otter and his wife.’ Now the courtiers well
knew that when the King made any slighting allusion to his
brother, they were expected to be tickled, so there was a
general roar. The Jester alone looked solemn. ‘I wonder,’
said he, ‘which is best, to play Tom Otter to your wife or to
your mistress?’—a sally which made Charles very angry, for
he felt the reference was made to Lady Castlemaine, of
whom the whole world knew he stood greatly in awe.</p>

<p class='c016'>Another evening Tom made a comic onslaught on Lord
Rochester, and that nobleman, actuated perhaps by <i>jalousie
de métier</i>, was so enraged that he dealt the Jester a swinging
box on the ear, unmindful of the royal presence, and threw
the whole Court circle into confusion.</p>

<p class='c016'>Death alone could put an end to poor Tom’s fooling. He
died at his post at Whitehall in 1682-3, and then ‘where
were his gibes, his gambols, his flashes of merriment, that
were wont to set the table in a roar? Alas! poor Yorick.’</p>

HE cannot do better in giving an account of
this most remarkable and exemplary woman
than to quote the words of her distinguished
son, Edward, tenth Lord Herbert of Cherbury:
‘My mother, Magdalen, was the
fourth daughter of Sir Richard Newport, by
his wife, Margaret, daughter and heir of Sir Thomas Bromley,
one of the Privy Council, and Executor of King Henry the
Eighth. She married Richard Herbert, grandson of Sir
Richard Herbert of Blackhall, County Montgomery, Knight,
and surviving her husband, gave rare testimonies of an incomparable
piety to God and love to her children. She was
most assiduous and devout in her daily, both private and
public, prayers, and so careful to provide for her posterity,
that though it were in her power to give her estate, which was
very great, to whom she would, yet she continued long unmarried,
and so provident for them, that after she had bestowed
all her daughters with sufficient portions upon very good neighbouring
families she delivered up her estate and care of her
housekeeping to her eldest son Francis. She had for many
years kept hospitality with that plenty and order as exceeded
all, either of her county or town, for besides abundance of
provision and good cheer for guests, which her son Sir
Francis continued, she used ever after dinner to distribute
with her own hands to the poor, who resorted to her in great
<span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>numbers. Alms in money she gave also, more or less, as she
thought they needed it. After my mother had lived most
virtuously and lovingly with her husband for many years (who
died in 1597), she after his death erected a fair monument for
him in Montgomery Church, brought up her children carefully,
and put them in good courses for making their fortunes,
and briefly was that woman Dr. Donne has described in his
funeral sermon.’</p>

<p class='c016'>Speaking of his father Lord Herbert says: ‘He was black-haired,
and bearded, of a manly but somewhat stern look, but
withal very handsome; compact in his limbs, and of a great
courage.’ His grandfather was also distinguished for the same
quality, and was noted to be a great enemy to the outlaws and
thieves of his time, who appeared in great numbers in the
mountains of Montgomeryshire. Lord Herbert also commends
his grandfather’s extreme hospitality, which caused it
to be an ordinary saying, if any one saw a fowl rise in the
country at that time—‘Fly where thou wilt, thou wilt light at
Blackhall.’</p>

<p class='c016'>Mistress Herbert had seven sons, of whom the eldest was
the aforementioned Lord Herbert of Cherbury, and three
daughters. She seems to have merited her son’s encomiums.
Izaak Walton says of her: ‘She was a person of superior
abilities, and was highly esteemed for her great and harmless
wit, cheerful gaiety, and obliging behaviour, which gained her
a friendship with most of any eminent birth or learning in the
University of Oxford, where she resided four years during the
time of her widowhood, in order to superintend the education
of her children, who were all young at the time of their
father’s death. When she had provided for them she took to
her second husband, Sir John Danvers, Knight, brother and
heir to Henry, Earl of Danby, who highly valued both her
person and most excellent endowments of mind. It was
Magdalen Newport, Mrs. Herbert, and Dame Danvers, who
<span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>inspired those favourite lines of Dr. Donne, Dean of St.

HE was the son of a blacksmith at Putney;
his mother, who married again, sent him
to a small school, where he learned little
more than reading, writing, and the rudiments
of Latin. When quite young he
evinced a passion for travel, and set out for
the Continent with very scanty means, which were soon exhausted,
and he found himself at Antwerp without money
or connections of any kind. But he was energetic and hard-working,
and he soon found employment as a clerk in an
English factory established in the city. Glad as Cromwell
was to earn his livelihood, the drudgery and confinement of
the life were irksome to the eager restless spirit of our young
adventurer, and he took advantage of the first opportunity to
escape. He made acquaintance with some countrymen from
Boston in Lincolnshire, bound for Rome, in order to obtain
certain indulgences from the reigning Pope, Julius the Second.
These men soon became aware that Cromwell’s intelligence
and capability were likely to make him a valuable fellow-traveller.
They therefore proposed to convey him to Italy,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>an offer with which it may be imagined Cromwell eagerly
closed. At Rome he rose into favour at the Vatican by his
talent and ability, added to which substantial qualifications
our young traveller made himself acceptable to the Pope by
ministering to the well-known tastes of Julius for good living.
He is said to have instructed the Papal cook in the art of
preparing many a delicacy for the Pontiff’s table, till then unknown
in Rome, especially ‘<i>some rare English jellies, which his
Holiness pronounced delicious</i>.’ Italy was at that period the
theatre of constant warfare, and Cromwell became not only a
spectator, but an actor in many of the exciting events, serving
for a time as trooper in the army of the Duke, afterwards
Connétable, de Bourbon.</p>

<p class='c016'>This great commander had left the service of France in
disgust, and had espoused the cause of Charles the Fifth,
Emperor of Germany. A companion in arms was John
Russell, eventually Earl of Bedford; a man who shone
alike as a soldier and a diplomatist, and had been employed
in the latter capacity by Henry the Eighth, and his prime
minister, Cardinal Wolsey. Being at Bologna a plot was formed
to seize his person and send him prisoner to Paris, the hotel
in which he lodged being already guarded by the soldiers of
the Gonfaloniere. Thomas Cromwell was also in Bologna
at that time, and no sooner did he receive intelligence of the
affair than he went to the municipal authorities representing
himself as a Neapolitan acquaintance of the English knight, and
offering to persuade him to give himself up quietly. He thus
gained access to Russell’s presence, and providing him with
the disguise of a peasant contrived in the most skilful manner
to effect his escape. Russell urged his deliverer to accompany
him, but Cromwell was not disposed to leave Italy so soon,
and entered the service of a rich merchant at Venice. Cromwell
was said to have been present at the battle of Pavia,
where Francis the First of France was taken prisoner. On his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>return to England, the man whose life and liberty he had
saved, came forward to lend him a helping hand.</p>

<p class='c016'>Russell, then in much repute at Court, recommended him
to the patronage of Wolsey, then in the zenith of his power.
The Cardinal took Cromwell into his service and confidence,
and made him secretary and chief agent in the great scheme
of the dissolution of the religious houses, which was now
carrying on, the funds thus raised being ostensibly apportioned
to defraying the expenses attendant on the erection
of the colleges which Wolsey was now founding—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c018'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Those twin seats of learning,</div>
      <div class='line in10'>Ipswich and Oxford.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c026'>But there were whisperings abroad that much of the money
thus obtained overflowed into the pockets of ‘master and
man,’ a circumstance which Cromwell emphatically denied in
a conversation with Master George Cavendish, one of the
Cardinal’s gentlemen, and his eventual biographer. The
question of Cromwell’s fidelity to his master, when Wolsey
fell on evil days, has been differently treated by different
writers; but there is no doubt that when Wolsey left London
in disgrace, Cromwell followed him to Esher—or Asher, as it
is written by Master Cavendish—who tells us he went into the
great chamber, and to his surprise found Master Cromwell
standing in the large window, the tears distilling from his eyes,
with a primer in his hand, praying earnestly,—‘the which was
a strange sight,’ for it did not appear that the said Master
Cromwell was by any means given to devotion. Cavendish
inquired into the cause of his sorrow, asking anxiously if he
considered their master’s case to be so very hopeless, on which
Cromwell, with much candour, confessed that it was his own
fate he was bewailing, for it seemed most likely that he was on
the point of losing everything for which he had been travailing
all the days of his life; moreover, that he was in disdain
<span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>of all men simply for doing his master’s service, through which
he had never increased his living, on the contrary, had been
a heavy loser. Then he confided to Master Cavendish how,
that very afternoon, when the Cardinal had dined, it was his
(Cromwell’s) intention to ride with all speed to London, and
so to Court, ‘where I will either make or mar ere I come back
again.’ Assuredly in the audience which he solicited and
obtained did Master Cromwell make, and not mar, as far as
he himself was concerned. He had a long and explicit conversation
with the King, into whose favour he ingratiated
himself by suggesting the very line of conduct on which he
well knew Henry’s heart was bent. Acquainted with the
Monarch’s infatuation for Anne Boleyn, he now suggested, as
if from his own notion of advisability, that the King should
throw off all allegiance to the Pope, declare himself supreme
head of the Church throughout his own kingdom, and thus
facilitate the much desired measure of his divorce from Queen
Katherine. Such palatable advice was indeed well calculated
to win Henry’s good graces, and from that moment
Cromwell’s rapid rise began. The King, knowing what a
valuable auxiliary he had proved to his late patron in the
matter of the suppression of the religious houses, resolved to
secure Cromwell’s services for the same purpose. He therefore
confirmed him in the office of Steward of the Dissolved
Monasteries, made him a Privy Councillor, a Knight, Secretary
of State, Master of the Royal Jewel-house, Clerk of the
Hanaper (a lucrative post in the Court of Chancery), and
what Cromwell’s enemies termed ‘the Lord knows what.’ In
1535 Visitor-General of the said suppressed monasteries
throughout the realm, in which capacity Sir Thomas incurred
much censure, and was branded by many as cruel, rapacious,
and overbearing. In our judgment of this sentence we must
take into consideration the fever heat at which religious
animosity now stood; suffice it to say that Cromwell satisfied
<span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>the views of his royal master, and was not Henry cruel,
rapacious, and overbearing? Fabulous sums were extorted
from the exchequers of these establishments, and it was
almost universally believed that the favourite came in for a
considerable share of the booty. It was indeed evident he
did not remember the injunction laid upon him by Sir Thomas
More, namely, that he should advise the King what he <i>ought</i>
to do, not only what he was <i>able</i> to do. In 1536 he was
made Privy Seal, and the same year Baron Cromwell of
Okeham, County Rutland, and (the authority of the Pope
being by this time abolished in England) Henry instituted
a new office, to which he appointed his favourite. This was
Vicar-General, or in other words, Supreme Head of the
Church, as representative of the King, in which capacity he
sat in the House of Lords, and also at Convocation above the
Archbishop of Canterbury. The office included that of Principal
Commissary for the Administration of Justice in all
ecclesiastical affairs; of the godly reformation, and the redress
of all errors, heresies, and abuses of the English Reformed
Church, both in Parliament and Convocation.</p>
<p class='c016'>It was indeed strange that the man who, a very short time
before, had professed infidel doctrines (and was so unsettled
in his creed that when Cavendish found him at prayers, the
primer in his hand should be our lady’s matins) strange to
say that this individual should now come forward as the
principal pillar of the Reformation. Dr. Hook, in his <i>Lives
of the Archbishops of Canterbury</i>, says, Cromwell ‘was not a
real Protestant, and was generally supposed to be a man
who supported the party from which he could obtain most,
a statesman whose religion depended on politics, and who
had no knowledge of theological subjects.’ Yet from the
circumstances in which he was now placed all the English
Protestants rallied round him, and those of Germany treated
with him. In his new capacity Cromwell issued the most
<span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>stringent and binding regulations for the conduct of the
reformed clergy, was indefatigable in propagating the Bible
throughout the country, causing it to be read in churches,
and placed in convenient parts of the building, where the
parishioners themselves could refer to it on their own account.
But Cromwell’s life forms part of the history of the reign of
Henry the Eighth, and indeed of the Reformation itself.
And it is incumbent on us to condense this narrative lest
it exceed the prescribed bounds.</p>

<p class='c016'>He continued to receive marks of favour from the King,
but his keen eye detected the gathering clouds in his own
future; and he knew if Henry once failed him there would
be little hope of stemming the tide of unpopularity which
threatened to overpower him. He well knew that he was
hated by all classes; the nobility, who grudged all the titles
and honours bestowed on ‘the blacksmith’s son’; the Roman
Catholics, who had good reason to detest him; while the reformed
clergy rebelled against many of the changes and innovations
which the Vicar-General had instituted in the services
and conduct of the Church; and the poorer classes were
indignant with him for depriving them of the bounty which
they had so long received from the religious houses. Cromwell
had good cause to be uneasy. He began by propitiating
‘the poor and needy,’ who now flocked by invitation to the gate
of his house in Throckmorton Street, oftentimes twice a day,
where they were regaled with bread and meat and money. He
then set on foot negotiations with the Protestant Princes of
Germany, more especially the reigning Duke of Cleves, in
order to bring about a marriage between that Prince’s sister
and Henry the Eighth, who was at this moment in one of
his transitory intervals of widowhood. Lord Cromwell imagined
that a Protestant queen of his own selection would be
an invaluable ally at Court, and help him to retain the favour
of the King, who was persuaded into the belief that the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span>Lady Anne of Cleves was not only ‘fair and portly,’ but
comely in face and feature, an error in which Henry was
confirmed by a very flattering portrait from the pencil of
Holbein. So the Princess was sent for to come over to
England, and a magnificent cortége was despatched, with the
Archbishop of Canterbury himself, to bring her on her way to
London; and Henry conceived the romantic idea of riding
down to Rochester in disguise to waylay his bride. Alas! for
the eager glance which his Grace cast into the travelling coach,
where sat a lady tall and portly indeed, but coarse and ugly in
face and feature! Henry, we are told, was ‘alarmed and
abashed,’ but he also was furious. He felt he had been deceived,
and he sent for Cromwell and bade him devise some
means for the prevention of the marriage. It was too late;
matters had gone too far, and the ceremony was performed.</p>

<p class='c016'>It would appear that at the time the King did not
realise the idea that Cromwell was the principal instigator
of the hated union, for it was after the marriage that he
was raised to the Earldom of Essex, and made Lord Chamberlain,
and his son granted a separate peerage. We know
from the pages of history how the King’s horror of ‘the
Flanders mare’ increased day by day, and he never rested
till he had obtained a divorce, soon followed by the downfall
of the newly created Earl of Essex, whose ruin was
resolved on.</p>

<p class='c016'>The Duke of Norfolk was intrusted with the task of arresting
his enemy at the Council Board on the opening of Parliament
in June 1540, and despatching him to the Tower, nor
was he loth to carry out the royal command. Essex claimed a
trial by his Peers, but the privilege was denied him. He was
condemned, says Dr. Hook, by the iniquitous statute, admitting
of attainder without trial, a measure of which he was not
the actual founder, as affirmed by some writers, but the reviver
<span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>of the same, and therefore by many pronounced deserving of
his fate.</p>

<p class='c016'>He was accused of high treason, heresy, embezzlement,
and a host of other misdemeanours, but there is little doubt
the worst offence in Henry’s eyes was his instrumentality in
promoting the hateful marriage with Anne of Cleves.</p>

<p class='c016'>The only voice that was raised in his behalf was that of
Archbishop Cranmer, who wrote a most eloquent letter to
the King, entreating him to spare the life of Lord Essex, but
it was unavailing. Cromwell’s demeanour in the Tower was
very different from that which had characterised Sir Thomas
More. He addressed the most abject letters to Henry, and
would have accepted life at almost any price. He wrote
‘with a heavy heart and trembling hand,’ and signed himself,
‘Your highness’s most humble and wretched prisoner and
poor slave, Thomas Cromwell.’ While underneath the
subscription came the words, ‘I cry for mercy, mercy,
mercy!’</p>

<p class='c016'>Henry caused the letters to be read to him four times,
and at one moment showed signs of relenting, but in the end
was (as usual) inexorable. Four days from the passing of
the sentence, Lord Essex was led forth to execution, and
beheaded on Tower Hill. He made a speech full of loyalty
and submission to the royal will, words which were thought
to have been dictated by paternal solicitude for the welfare
of his only son. He furthermore confessed his sins, repenting
that he had ever abandoned the Catholic faith to which
he now returned, for in that he was resolved to die; then
kneeling in prayer, ‘he submitted his neck to the executioner,
who mangled him in a shocking manner.’</p>

Bart., by Elizabeth, daughter and co-heir of
Edward Mytton, Esq. of Weston-under-Lizard,
which estate (besides a large fortune
from her father) Lady Bradford inherited
from her mother, and brought into the Newport family.</p>

<p class='c016'>It is seldom the lot of any woman to live continuously in
one loved home, but Mary Wilbraham was born, married,

Newport family. Francis, Earl of Bradford, and his wife were

comeliness of her person.</p>

<p class='c016'>They accordingly made good settlements on Lord Newport
to facilitate the union. We have a list of the lands and messuages

HE was the eldest son of the first Earl of Bradford,
by Lady Diana Russell. During his
father’s lifetime he represented Shropshire in
Parliament for many years, and gained great
popularity in his county by his strenuous
support of the Bill of Exclusion, which
obtained for him a complimentary address signed by every
member of the grand jury, consisting of all the principal landholders
of the neighbourhood. He was Privy Councillor in
the reigns of Queen Anne and George the First, and Lord

THE son of Dr. John Bridgeman, Bishop of
Chester, by Elizabeth, daughter of Dr. Helyar,
Canon of Exeter, and Archdeacon of Barnstaple.
Educated by his father until he
went to Queens’ College, Cambridge, where
he took his degree of B.A. in 1623. The following
year he entered the Inner Temple, and applied himself
vigorously to the study of common law, ‘of which he became,’
says Lord Campbell, ‘a profound master, caring little in
comparison for either literature or politics.’ When called to
the bar he made himself remarkable for his diligent attention
to business, although he had the expectation of a goodly
inheritance from his father. At the commencement of the
Long Parliament Orlando Bridgeman was returned for the
borough of Wigan in Lancashire. He voted silently, but,
with the exception of some measures on which he had conscientious
scruples, almost invariably for the King. He was
also one of the few who voted against the attainder of Lord
Strafford, in whose behalf he made a short but manly appeal.
When the civil war broke out Orlando did not indeed, as
was the case with several lawyers, throw aside the gown for
the sword; but he went into the north, and in the city of
Chester, and elsewhere, did the King good service by affording
the royal troops all the assistance in his power, in cooperation
with his father, the Bishop of the diocese. Clarendon
tells us how ‘the city of Chester remained true to his Majesty,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span>influenced thereto by the credit and example of Bishop John
Bridgeman, and the reputation and dexterity of his son
Orlando, a lawyer of very good estimation.’ For these proofs
of loyalty Bridgeman was expelled the House of Commons,
and the Bishop’s estates sequestrated. But when Charles
summoned the members of both Houses that had been
faithful to him, to his own Parliament at Oxford, Orlando
Bridgeman took his seat as member for Wigan, in Christchurch
Hall, and was there nominated by patent (sealed by
Lord-Keeper Lyttleton) to the post of Attorney-General of
the Court of Wards and Liveries, ‘an office,’ says Lord
Campbell, ‘when actually exercised, of great importance and
emolument, but now a mere feather in his cap, which Parliament
would not allow him to wear in their sight. At the
time of the Treaty of Uxbridge, Bridgeman was chosen one
of the Commissioners, and was thereto designated by his new
title, but the potentates of Westminster would not acknowledge
the appointment as valid, and treated him as plain
Orlando Bridgeman.’ When Oxford capitulated to Fairfax,
he retired to his country house at Morton, where he was
joined by the Bishop, and afterwards he proceeded privately
to London.</p>

<p class='c016'>During the interregnum he refused to put on his gown
or to plead, but contented himself with acting as a conveyancer
or chamber counsel. Yet we are informed that he took
great note of passing events, whether judicial or political, and
though he prudently abstained from any small plot hatching
in the King’s name, which he considered would be prejudicial
to the royal cause, yet to the great measures which affected
the Restoration our lawyer gave his strong adherence, and
rejoiced in the return of Charles the Second to England. He
had quick promotion, being made Serjeant-at-Law, Lord
Chief Baron of the Exchequer, and Speaker of the House of
Lords in the absence of the Lord Chancellor. His conduct
<span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>on the trial of the regicides has naturally been differently
judged, according to the bias of party feeling, but at all events
his eloquence in charging the jury was highly extolled at the
time, and when he had concluded the applause was so great
that Judge Bridgeman felt himself called upon to check the
expression thereof, saying, ‘that it was more suitable for the
audience of a stage-play rather than a court of justice.’ His
language indeed was rather fantastic and flowery, but that was
the fashion at the time. He explained that ‘the treason of the
prisoners consisted not only in compassing and imagining the
King’s death, but in executing him in front of his own palace;
in fact, not only laying the cockatrice’s egg, but brooding upon
the same, until it had brought forth a serpent!’ On the expiration
of the trials, Bridgeman was made a Baronet and Chief-Justice
of the Common Pleas; and it was said of him that
while presiding in this Court his reputation was at its zenith,
and ‘his moderation and equity were such that he seemed to
carry a chancery in his breast.’ In the intrigues which were
being carried on against Lord Clarendon, Sir Orlando took no
part; indeed his conduct was invariably marked by generosity
towards the man whom he was destined to supplant, and he
did all in his power to prevent the Chancellor’s impeachment.
In 1667 he was appointed Lord-Keeper at the instigation of
some of the King’s advisers, male and female, and it was
whispered among his enemies that in that capacity he was at
first more complaisant than his predecessor in affixing the
great seal to royal grants, in favour of such personages as
Lady Castlemaine, and others of her calibre. Be this as it
may, the atrocious proceedings of the Cabal roused the Lord-Keeper
into resistance, and the opposition he offered to these
unscrupulous men hastened his downfall. His own family
were also most prejudicial to his prosperity, his wife being an
‘intriguer and intermeddler,’ combining with his sons in
matters with which they had no concern. Bridgeman was losing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span>favour at Court; he had lately made himself obnoxious to
the King and his surroundings by opposing many of their
measures, and when he refused to confirm the Act of Toleration
on the ground of illegality, Lord Shaftesbury hastened
to Charles’s presence bent on mischief, for that nobleman
had long had his eyes greedily directed towards the Great
Seal, and he became very eloquent in counting up all Sir
Orlando’s misdemeanours, ending by his <i>disinterested</i> advice
for that minister’s instant dismissal. Charles took a little
time to be persuaded, but after a while he sent off secretary
Coventry to demand the bone of contention from the Lord-Keeper.
Bridgeman was all unprepared for the hasty and
peremptory message, but he had no option, and the Great Seal
was delivered to the royal messenger. Charles kept it in
his own custody all night, and the next morning consigned
it with the title of Lord Chancellor into the willing hands of
Anthony Ashley Cooper. After his dismissal from office Sir
Orlando retired to his villa near Teddington, where he died,
and was buried. He was twice married—first to Judith,
daughter and heir of John Kynaston, Esq. of Morton, County
Salop, who died at Oxford, during the usurpation, and was
there buried. He had an only son, Sir John Bridgeman,
his successor. Sir Orlando had for his second wife, Dorothy,
daughter of Dr. Saunders, Provost of Oriel College, Oxford,
and relict of George Cradock, Esq. of Carsewell Castle,
County Stafford, by whom he had two sons and one daughter,
namely, Sir Orlando, created a Baronet; Sir Francis,
knighted in 1673, who married Susanna, daughter and heir
of Sir Richard Barker, Knight, but had no children; and
Charlotte, married to Sir Thomas Myddleton of Chirk Castle.</p>

<p class='c016'>As must invariably be the case with men in prominent
positions, more especially in times of great civil, religious,
and political struggles, Sir Orlando Bridgeman’s character was
by turns eulogised and blamed; in spite of his loyal services
<span class='pageno' id='Page_174'>174</span>to Charles the First, that King found occasion to censure
his faithful servant at the time of the Treaty of Uxbridge,
on a question of religion, ‘having,’ said his Majesty,
‘expected otherwise from the son of a Bishop.’ Yet Sir
Orlando was a staunch Churchman. Burnet’s testimony was
merely to his judicial capacity. He said: ‘Bridgeman’s practice
was so entirely in common law that he did not seem
to understand what equity was.’ Roger North said: ‘He
was a celebrated lawyer, and sat with high esteem in the place
of Chief-Justice of Common Pleas: the moving him then
to the Chancery did not contribute to his fame’; while elsewhere
we are told ‘he carried a chancery in his breast.’ ‘He
grew timorous, which was not mended by age; he laboured
to please everybody, and that is a temper of ill consequence
in a judge.’ On the other hand, Lord Nottingham writes: ‘It
is due to the memory of so great a man to mention him with
reverence and veneration for his learning and integrity.’
While Lord Ellenborough extols him as an eminent judge,
distinguished by the profundity of his learning and the extent
of his industry. At all events, there is no doubt that the name
of Sir Orlando Bridgeman, Lord-Keeper of the Great Seal,
continues to be honoured, not only in the annals of his own
family, but in the learned profession of the Law.</p>

EDWARD BRIDGEMAN was the younger
son of William Bridgeman of Dean Parva,
in the county of Gloucester. He settled in
the city of Exeter, and was, in 1578, High-Sheriff
of the said city and the county of
Devon. His son John was born in Exeter,
in a house not far from the palace-gate, which seemed an
omen of his future dignity. He was a studious boy, and
loved his books, and was carefully kept at school until it was
deemed advisable ‘to transplant him to the University,’ when
he was entered at Magdalen College, Cambridge, of which he
became a Fellow, and eventually the Master. In 1600, being
M.A., he was admitted <i>ad eundem</i> at Oxford, and here he
attained the degree of Doctor of Divinity, being the highest,
we are told, ‘a scholar can receive, or the University bestow.’
Dr. Bridgeman’s character for learning and piety, combined
with refinement of manners and good breeding, had reached
the ears of King James the First, who appointed him one of
his Domestic Chaplains, and soon afterwards he became incumbent
of Wigan in Lancashire. For upwards of two
hundred years, even to the present day, the living in question
has been held, with scarcely any intermission, by a member of
the family of Bridgeman. In 1619 the Doctor was raised to the
See of Chester, being consecrated at Lambeth, at the same
time as the Bishops of Oxford and Bristol. Now the King
<span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span>taking into consideration that the Bishopric of Chester was
less lucrative than some others, His Majesty also preferred
John Bridgeman to the living of Bangor in Wales, which he
was to hold <i>ad commendam</i>, or temporarily. Collins tells us
that his Lordship was not present in the Upper House, in the
year 1641, when the bishops protested against the proceedings
in Parliament, and were impeached, and sent to the Tower,
whereby he was saved the tedious imprisonment to which
his right reverend brethren were subjected. But all his proclivities
were Royalist, and during the usurpation, his estates
being sequestrated, he took refuge at his son’s country house
at Moreton, near Oswestry, in Salop, where he died about the
year 1657 or 1658, being buried in the neighbouring church
of Kinnerley, and not in the Cathedral of Chester, as some
writers have it.</p>

<p class='c016'>This worthy Prelate was said to have been ‘as ingenious
as he was brave, and a great patron of those gifts in others
which he himself owned. He, moreover, was the father of
that great and good man, Sir Orlando Bridgeman, the Lord-Keeper,
who was a glory to his family, and indeed to the
country at large.’ The Bishop of Chester married Elizabeth,
daughter of Dr. Helyar (of a good old Somersetshire family),
Canon of Exeter, and Archdeacon of Barnstaple, by whom he
had five sons—</p>

<p class='c016'>1. Sir Orlando Bridgeman, afterwards First Baronet, and
eventually Lord-Keeper.</p>

<p class='c016'>2. Dove, Prebendary of Chester, married Miss Bennet of
Cheshire (who survived him), by whom he had one son,
Charles, Archdeacon of Richmond, in Yorkshire, who died
unmarried 1678. The widow of Dove Bridgeman married, as
her second husband, Dr. John Halkett, Bishop of Lichfield.</p>

<p class='c016'>3. Henry Bridgeman, who was indeed rich in church preferment,
being successively Rector of Bangor and Barrow, and
Bishop of the Isle of Man. He married Catherine, daughter
<span class='pageno' id='Page_177'>177</span>of Robert Lever, of Lancashire, Gent., by whom he had one
daughter, who married Sir Thomas Greenhalgh of Brundlesham,
County Lancaster.</p>

<p class='c016'>4. Sir James Bridgeman, Knight, who married the daughter
of one Mr. Allen, a gentleman of Cheshire, by whom he had
(beside a son and daughter, who died unmarried) Frances,
wife of William, Lord Howard of Escrick, and Magdalen, wife
of William Wynder, Esq.</p>

<p class='c016'>5. Richard, a merchant in Amsterdam, married the
daughter of one Mr. Watson, also an English merchant in
that city, by whom he had a daughter, Elizabeth, married to
John Dove, Surveyor of the Customs; and a son, William, of
Westminster, some time Secretary of the Admiralty, and one
of the Clerks of the Privy Council, who married Diana,
daughter of Mr. Vernatti, an Italian gentleman. Their
children were Orlando, and Catherine, married to a relative,
son of Sir John Bridgeman, Bart.</p>

HE was the eldest son of Richard Newport,
second Earl of Bradford, by Mary Wilbraham.
He represented Shropshire in several Parliaments
during his father’s life, and was at
different times Lord-Lieutenant and <i>Custos
Rotulorum</i> of the Counties of Stafford, Shropshire,
and Montgomery. Lord Bradford died unmarried at
his house in St. James’s Place, and was buried in Henry the
Seventh’s Chapel at Westminster.</p>

<p class='c016'>He was succeeded in his titles, and such estates as he could
not alienate, by his brother Thomas, who had become imbecile
through a fall from his horse in early life in Cowhay Wood,
Weston Park. He was incompetent to manage his own affairs,
and, dying at Weston, 1762, his titles became extinct, and his
property descended to his nephews, the sons of Lady Anne
Bridgeman; and the Countess of Mountrath. Henry, Lord
Bradford was an immoral and vindictive man, and having
quarrelled with his mother on account of her endeavour to
disentangle him from some disgraceful connection, he vowed
vengeance on her and her whole family. This threat he
carried out in a shameful manner, and though the story is long
and complicated, yet it bears so nearly on the fortunes of the
present possessor of Weston, that we cannot refrain from
entering into details. In 1715, Lord Bradford cut off and
debarred all the then existing entails of the family estates over
which he had any power, and in 1730 he made a will by which
he left all his large estates in trust, for the use of John Newport,
<i>alias</i> Harrison, <i>alias</i> Smyth, his illegitimate son by Anne,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span>wife of Ralph Smyth, son of the Dean of Raphoe, that lady
being then Lord Bradford’s mistress; the property to revert
to the testator’s lawful heirs in the event of the aforementioned
John’s death without children. But two days afterwards he
repented of this partial act of compensation, and added a
codicil by which he left the same property to the same trustees,
in case of John’s death without heirs, to his mother, Mrs. Anne
Smyth, for her own personal use, to be devised as she saw fit,
provided that during John’s lifetime she should set aside a
proper sum for his use and maintenance, after which she
might make any use she chose of the residue. Four days afterwards
another codicil assured the lady in question a further
sum of £10,000.</p>

<p class='c016'>Lord Bradford died in 1734, and Mrs. Anne Smyth in
1742, having two months before her death made a will leaving
all the property bequeathed her by the said Earl to one Alexander
Small, a surgeon (excepting as before what was set aside
for the maintenance of John Newport), until John should
have attained his majority, which was not to be until he was
twenty-six years old. In the event of John Newport’s death
without children, then the reversion and inheritance of the
said estates she devised to William Pulteney, afterwards Earl
of Bath, his heirs and assigns for ever. It would be tedious
to relate all the legal proceedings which arose out of this
eccentric will; suffice it to say that it could not be proved till
1751, nine years after the death of the testatrix. Lord Bath
on his part devised the reversion of the property expectant on
the death of John Newport, to his brother, General Harry
Pulteney, who in turn devised it to the daughter of his cousin-german
(Daniel Pulteney), Frances, wife of William Johnstone,
and her said husband (who afterwards became a baronet, and
took the name of Pulteney), and to their heirs in tail male,
with remainder to Harry, Earl of Darlington, whose grandmother
was Anne Pulteney, aunt to the Earl of Bath, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_180'>180</span>daughter of Sir William Pulteney of Misterton, County Leicester
and his sons in tail male.</p>

<p class='c016'>All these aforementioned legatees died in succession
without male heirs, excepting the Earl of Darlington, who left
an only son, afterwards Duke of Cleveland, on whom the
whole of this enormous fortune devolved, and is part of the
heritage of the present Duke (1888). Thus the ancient
estates of the Newports, including those which descended to
them from the Princes of South Wales, passed away from the
rightful owners, excepting Weston-under-Lizard, Walsall, and
some other estates elsewhere mentioned, which became the property
of Sir Henry Bridgeman, grandson of Mary, Countess
of Bradford. The savings from the estate during the lifetime
of John Newport, which were said to exceed £200,000, were
ultimately divided (after deducting the great law charges)
between the Crown (to which it passed in default of heirs),
and, through a ridiculous quibble of the law, the representatives
of Ralph Smyth (John Newport’s mother’s husband).</p>

EDWARD, first Lord Herbert of Ripsford, the
‘noble author’ of whom Horace Walpole
speaks in terms of the highest enthusiasm,
and whose autobiography he published, was
succeeded by his son Richard, who married
a daughter of John, Earl of Bridgewater, by
whom he had two surviving sons (who in turn succeeded to
the title) and two daughters. The youngest, Florence, married
her kinsman, Richard Herbert of Oakley Park. Edward,
third Lord Herbert of Cherbury, a zealous loyalist, dying

HE was the eldest son of Sir Richard Newport,
Kt. of High Ercall, who was knighted by
King James the First, at Theobalds, and, in
1642, in consequence of his unswerving
loyalty to King Charles the First, created
Baron Newport. Sir Richard married
Rachel, daughter of Sir John Leveson, Kt. of Haling, or
Halington, County Kent, and sister to Sir Richard Leveson of
Trentham, County Stafford, Knight of the Bath. Francis was
the first born of a large family, and began public life at an early
age, being chosen to represent the borough of Shrewsbury in
Parliament, a few days after he had attained his majority.
He was one of the few members (fifty-six in number) who
had the courage to vote for the acquittal of Lord Strafford,
a proceeding which brought down on the heads of the so-called
‘Straffordians’ both insult and obloquy. He followed
in the footsteps of his father, declared for the Royal cause in
the unhappy differences between Charles and his Parliament,
and was soon expelled the House of Commons as a ‘malignant.’
He took arms in the Royal army, and did gallant service in
the field, till he was made prisoner at Oswestry, when that
town was taken by the Earl of Denbigh and Colonel
Mytton. At the time of the insurrection in North Wales,
Francis Newport proved himself a zealous friend to Charles
the Second, and as powerful as he was zealous. He was
also engaged in the unsuccessful siege of Shrewsbury, which
town, in the beginning of the ensuing year, was once more
<span class='pageno' id='Page_184'>184</span>in the hands of the Royalists. On this occasion, as we have
mentioned elsewhere, Sir Edward Hyde (Lord Clarendon)
was sorely puzzled as to the respective claims to the Governorship
of Shrewsbury, between Sir Thomas Myddleton, and his
friend, Francis Newport. Two months after the restoration
of the King (May 29, 1660), Lord Newport was appointed
Lord-Lieutenant and <i>Custos Rotulorum</i> of Shropshire, and
later on, by Charles the Second, Comptroller and Treasurer
of the Household, and a Privy Councillor. In 1674 he was
advanced to the title of Viscount Newport of Bradford, County
Salop, and, on the accession of James the Second, his lordship
was continued in all his former offices for a time, but he
was a true patriot, and the arbitrary and unconstitutional
measures of the new King called forth in him a vigorous
opposition. So open was he in the expression of his political
opinions that he was not only superseded in all his offices at
Court, but was also removed from the Lord-Lieutenancy of
Shropshire, which was given up to the unworthy hands of the
Lord Chancellor Jefferies. He upheld the cause of religion at
the trial of the seven Bishops, and, being a firm Protestant, he
voted for the succession of the Prince and Princess of Orange.
On the day that William and Mary were proclaimed, Lord
Newport was reinstated in his posts in the Royal Household
and his Lord-Lieutenancy of Shropshire, in all of which offices
he continued until he attained the age of eighty-four, when they
devolved on his son. In 1694 he was created Earl of Bradford,
and on the accession of Queen Anne again sworn of the Privy
Council. Lord Newport was an object of special dislike to
James the Second, as we find from one of the ex-King’s
declarations (respecting a projected descent upon England),
that this nobleman would certainly be debarred from all hope of
pardon. Lord Bradford died at Twickenham in his eighty-ninth
year, and was buried at Wroxeter, near his country house of
Eyton, in Shropshire, where a marble monument on the south
<span class='pageno' id='Page_185'>185</span>wall of the chancel bears a long inscription to his memory.
It was written of him that ‘at the time of his death, he was
the most venerable character of any nobleman in England,
on account of his virtues, and the unblemished honour with
which he had filled every station of life. Equally a friend to
the clergy and to the poor, having enlarged the endowments of
several poor vicarages, and erected a charitable foundation at
Ercall for the support of the needy.’ King William had so
great a regard for the Earl of Bradford, that he paid him a
visit, and honoured him with his presence at dinner on his
eightieth birthday. He married Lady Diana Russell, daughter
of the fourth Earl of Bedford, by whom he had a large family,
five dying in their infancy; and</p>

<p class='c016'>Richard, second Earl of Bradford;</p>

<p class='c016'>Francis, who died unmarried;</p>

<p class='c016'>Thomas, a Commissioner of the Customs in the reigns of
William and Mary, and Queen Anne, who, in the first year
of George the First was made a Lord of the Treasury and
raised to the peerage by the title of Baron Torrington of
Torrington, County Devon, and sworn of the Privy Council.
He was also at the time of his death a Teller of the Exchequer.
He had three wives: first, Lucy, daughter of Sir Edward
Atkyns, Lord Chief Justice of the Exchequer in the time of
James the Second; second, Penelope, daughter of Sir Orlando
Bridgeman of Ridley, County Chester, Bart., who died in 1705;
third, Anne, daughter of Robert Pierrepoint of Nottingham,
Esq., son of Francis Pierrepoint, and grandson of Robert, Earl
of Kingston. He died the 27th of May 1719, in the sixty-fifth
year of his age (when his title became extinct), and lies buried
at Wroxeter with Anne, his third wife, who survived him many
years, and died on the 7th February 1734.</p>

HE was the son of Sir Lionel Tollemache of
Helmingham, County Norfolk, by Lady
Elizabeth Murray, elder daughter and heir
of William Murray, Lord Huntingtower,
first Earl of Dysart. These honours were
conferred on William Murray, a member of
a younger branch of the house of Tullibardine by Charles the
First, with remainder to heirs male and female. His eldest
<span class='pageno' id='Page_192'>192</span>daughter, Elizabeth, married Sir Lionel Tollemache, and
succeeded her father as Countess of Dysart in her own right,
having obtained from Charles the Second, in 1670, a confirmation
of her honours, with a clause in the charter allowing
her to nominate any one of her children she pleased as her
heir. After the death of Sir Lionel Tollemache, his widow
married the Duke of Lauderdale, and dying in 1697 was
succeeded by her eldest son, Sir Lionel Tollemache,
as Lord Huntingtower and Earl of Dysart. He was
M.P. for Orford in 1678 and 1685, and represented the
County of Suffolk until he was incapacitated from sitting in
the House by the passing of the Act of Union with Scotland.
He had declined an English barony upon the accession of
Queen Anne. He married, in 1680, Grace, daughter and
co-heir of Sir Thomas Wilbraham, by whom he had a son and
two daughters. The eldest son, who married Miss Cavendish,
died <i>v.p.</i>, and their son succeeded his grandfather as Earl of

THE second son of Robert Rich, first Earl
of Warwick, by Lady Penelope Devereux,
daughter of Walter, Earl of Essex. He went
to France and Holland in his youth, and
returning to England appeared at Court,
where he attracted the notice and favour of
George, Duke of Buckingham, who was then all-powerful with
King James the First. It appears to have been through Buckingham’s
intervention that he married the rich heiress of Sir John
Cope of Kensington, of which place Rich shortly bore the title
of Baron. He also held offices at Court about the King’s
person, and that of Henry Prince of Wales; was made Earl
of Holland, Knight of the Garter, Privy Councillor, and sent
Ambassador to negotiate the marriage of Prince Charles, first
in Spain and afterwards in France. On the latter occasion it
was rumoured that his beauty and courtliness made a deep impression
on the heart of his future Queen, Henrietta Maria.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_196'>196</span>Clarendon says of him that ‘he was of a lovely and winning
presence, and genteel conversation.’ He also accompanied
the Duke of Buckingham to Holland on a diplomatic mission.
On the first breaking out of an insurrection of the Scots, he
was made General of the Horse, and though not in arms at
the commencement of the Civil War, when evil days fell on the
King, Lord Holland joined him with many other loyal noblemen,
and on his being appointed General of the Royal army,
numbers flocked to ask commissions from him. In 1648,
after many fluctuations of fortune, he was pursued and taken
prisoner near St. Neot’s in Huntingdonshire, whence he was
conveyed to Warwick House, and finally to the Tower, and a
High Court of Justice was appointed to sit for the trial of the
Earl of Holland, the Duke of Hamilton, and other Peers.
He was in ill-health at the time, and when examined answered
little, ‘as a man who would rather receive his life from their
favour than from the strength of his defence.’ He was condemned,
however, in spite of the influence of his brother, the
Earl of Warwick, and the exertions of the Presbyterian party.
There was not a large majority against him, but Cromwell, it
would appear, disliked him extremely, and accordingly on the
9th of March 1649, Lord Holland suffered death immediately
after the Duke of Hamilton.</p>

<p class='c016'>Spent by long sickness, he addressed but few words to the
people, recommending them with his last breath to uphold the
King’s government and the established religion.</p>

<p class='c016'>He left four sons and five daughters. Robert, the eldest,
succeeded to his father’s honours, and likewise to the Earldom
of Warwick on the death of his uncle in 1672.</p>

THE second son of the Duke de Bouillon, by
Elizabeth of Nassau, daughter of William
the Silent and Charlotte de Montpensier.
His father being one of the chief Calvinist
leaders, brought up his two sons, the Prince
de Sedan and the Vicomte de Turenne, in
the most rigid tenets of that party. From early childhood
young Turenne had set his heart on becoming a soldier, and
many interesting anecdotes are recorded of his boyish enthusiasm.
His military exploits, his daring gallantry and skill as
a commander, have made his name world-renowned, and the
battles that he won, the wonderful vicissitudes of his career,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_198'>198</span>both political and military, belong to the pages of European
history.</p>

<p class='c016'>He was killed by a stray shot at the beginning of an engagement
with the Imperialist troops near the village of Salzbach.
His death was deeply deplored by his soldiery, of whom he
was the idol, and caused general consternation in Paris.
Madame de Sévigné in one of her letters gives a most graphic
account of the effect produced by the news of his death at
Court, which, for a time, suspended the usual routine of
festivity.</p>

the Bridgeman family, by the Hon. Lucy
Byng. He married as his first wife, in
1818, Georgina, only daughter of Sir
Thomas Moncreiffe, Bart., of Moncreiffe, by
whom he had Orlando George, his successor,
the present Earl; the Hon. and Rev. George Bridgeman,
rector of Wigan; the Hon. and Rev. John Bridgeman, rector
of Weston; and four daughters. Lady Bradford died in 1842,
and the Earl married, secondly, Helen, widow of Sir David
Moncreiffe, Bart., and daughter of Æneas Mackay, Esq. of
Scotston, Peebles. She died in 1869.</p>

<p class='c016'>Without taking an active part in politics, his principles
were those of a staunch Conservative. He was an excellent
landlord, and took delight in enlarging and improving
his property. In his family he was beloved; in his
household highly respected. He wrote a book entitled
<i>Letters from Portugal, Spain, and Sicily</i>, when he travelled
to those countries, accompanied by Lord John Russell and
the Hon. Robert Clive, in 1812. This volume was privately
printed in 1875 by his son, the present Earl, and showed
him to have been a man of culture and refinement of taste,
more especially in points of art and literature. In both
<span class='pageno' id='Page_203'>203</span>branches he distinguished himself as a collector. The Vicar
of Tong, who had known Lord Bradford intimately for
upwards of twenty years, in a speech made at a public dinner,
speaks in the highest terms of his deceased patron, of his unaffected
piety and of his profound sense of justice, and holds
him up as an example to the surviving generation.</p>

HE was the youngest son of Lord John Russell,
afterwards sixth Duke of Bedford, by the
Honourable Georgiana Elizabeth Byng. In
an able article in the <i>Times</i> of 1878 mention
is thus made of this eminent statesman:—‘He
took an early interest in politics, and by
the time he left college his political faith had crystalised into
something very like that in which he lived, laboured, and died.’
A visit to the Peninsula, where the star of Wellington was
then in the ascendant, modified his French ideas (he had
commenced by being an ardent advocate of the Revolution
in France) and inspired young Russell with such an admiration
for the hero that ever afterwards in the fiercest political
struggle he maintained towards the Duke the attitude and
language of profound admiration. His subsequent career
belongs to the history of his country. He was a zealous
upholder of Catholic Emancipation, and in the cause of
Parliamentary Reform was the leading spirit, the draft for the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_212'>212</span>first Bill of which was drawn up by his own hand. He sat
for numerous constituencies in the House of Commons for a
period of forty-seven years, during many of which he was the
leader of the Opposition. He filled many of the highest
offices of State, and was First Lord of the Treasury from 1846
to 1852. In 1865 he was again at the head of the Government
from which he retired in 1866, having been raised to
the peerage as Earl Russell and Viscount Amberley in 1861,
and created a K.G.</p>

<p class='c016'>His first wife was Adelaide, daughter of Thomas Lister of
Armitage Park, widow of the second Lord Ribblesdale (who
died in 1838 leaving two daughters).</p>

<p class='c016'>His second wife was Lady Frances Elliot, daughter of
Gilbert, second Earl of Minto, by whom he had three sons
and a daughter.</p>

<p class='c016'>Lord Russell was an author as well as a statesman, and
published several works political, historical, dramatic, etc.
He died at Pembroke Lodge in Richmond Park.</p>

DAUGHTER of Ferdinand, Elector of Bavaria.
Born at Munich. Negotiations being set
on foot for the marriage of this Princess
with the Dauphin of France, King Louis
the Fourteenth sent De Troyes to paint a
portrait of her, and likewise a confidential
envoy to give some description of his future daughter-in-law.
The report was satisfactory; for although not a real beauty,
Maria Christina possessed great perfection of form, and was
lively and agreeable. She was united to Louis, Dauphin of
France, in 1680, at Châlons-sur-Marne, where the French
court repaired to do honour to the nuptials. Anxious to find
favour in the eyes of her father-in-law, she perfectly succeeded
in the attempt, for the King found her very accomplished,
well-informed, of great conversational powers, and wonderfully
ready at repartee, while her easy, unconstrained, though
<span class='pageno' id='Page_215'>215</span>refined manners surprised the court of the Louvre. The
only drawback to the bride’s popularity was her love of quiet
and retirement; and after the festivities attending the celebration
of the marriage were concluded, the Dauphine evinced
her predilection for a small and intimate coterie, and the
propensity to yield too implicitly to the influence of one of
her Bavarian ladies, which caused some jealousy. Her time
was fully occupied by reading and devotional exercises. The
King strove in vain to wean her from pursuits which tended
to seclusion from the world; but, finding his attempts useless,
he no longer thwarted her inclinations. The Dauphine was
very ill at the time of the birth of her third son, the Duc de
Berry, and never recovered her health. When she felt her
end approaching, she sent for the child, whom she embraced
tenderly and blessed, concluding with these touching words:
‘C’est de bon cœur quoique tu me coutes bien cher.’ She
also took a tender leave of her eldest son, the Duc de
Bourgogne (father of Louis <span class='fss'>XV.</span>). Louis the Fourteenth sat
by the deathbed of his daughter-in-law, and when advised to
withdraw, he said, ‘No; it is better I should see how my
equals die;’ and he spoke some admonitory words in the
same strain to the Dauphin, who was also present, on the
transitory nature of earthly grandeur. The Dauphine’s
funeral oration was preached by Fléchier, and considered a
<i>chef-d’œuvre</i>.</p>

    <div>QUEEN VICTORIA INVESTING THE SULTAN WITH THE ORDER OF THE GARTER ON BOARD THE ROYAL YACHT.</div>

THIS picture was painted by permission of
the Queen for Lord Bradford, who as Lord
Chamberlain assisted at the ceremony. Mr.
Thomas painted the same subject in a large
picture for the Queen, and he died before
he had finished this replica.</p>

<p class='c016'>The Queen wished to confer the Order of the Garter upon
the Sultan without any previous notice, and the Lord
<span class='pageno' id='Page_238'>238</span>Chamberlain was commissioned to borrow the Insignia from
two of the Princes, K.G.s, who were on board. This he did
by procuring the Blue Ribbon and George from Prince Arthur,
and the Star from Prince Louis of Hesse. After the investiture
the Sultan was told, through his interpreter, that the Queen
had ordered more costly Insignia on purpose for His Imperial
Majesty, and that as soon as these were ready they should be
exchanged for those employed to-day. Upon which, without
a moment’s hesitation, the Sultan said to the Lord Chamberlain,
through his interpreter, ‘No, no, those which the
Queen has herself placed on me, I will never part from.’</p>

<p class='c016'>We are tempted to insert this anecdote as it has an
historical interest, and one cannot but feel that the Sultan’s
speech betokened the chivalry of a newly dubbed knight.</p>

Stepmother,’ and afterwards as Celia in ‘The Rivals,’ an
adaptation by Davenant of the ‘Two Noble Kinsmen.’ Pepys
makes frequent mention of her, and was a great admirer of her
talent. He even pits her against Nell Gwynne: ‘Little Mistress
Davies danced a jig at the end of the play in boy’s clothes, far
superior to Nelly’s performance in the same character.’ It is
true he calls her an impertinent slut, but that did not prevent
the King from losing his heart, and my lady Castlemaine from
being very jealous, seeing Charles’s eyes were fixed all the
time of the play on Mistress Moll. But what especially fascinated
his Merry Majesty were the wild, mad, melodious songs she
sang, and her wonderful grace and arch demeanour in dancing.
Charles bought and furnished a house for her, and made her a
present of a ring which cost £600, a large sum in those days.
He had a daughter by her, called Mary Tudor, who was born
in 1673, and married a son of Sir Francis Ratcliffe, afterwards
Earl of Derwentwater.</p>

SHE first attracted notice by her beauty and
arch demeanour when selling oranges in the
taverns and theatres. She studied acting
under the elocutionists Hart and Lacy, both
very much esteemed in the dramatic profession
at the time. Her talents soon made her
distinguished on the stage, but she seldom attempted tragedy.
Her sprightliness and grace soon attracted the attention of the
King, and before this period she was said to have counted
the Duke of Buckingham and Lord Dorset among her admirers.
The enemies of the Duchess of Cleveland were glad of an opportunity
of recommending pretty Mistress Nell as a rival to
the haughty beauty, to whom she stood in strange contrast,
both in appearance and good-humour. In 1663 she was still
a member of the King’s company at Drury Lane, and was supposed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_251'>251</span>to have quitted the stage about 1672. Pepys, in speaking
of her in 1665, calls her ‘pretty witty Nell,’ and in 1666 he
mentions that he went with his wife to see ‘The Maiden
Queen’ by Dryden, in which there is a comical part taken by
Nell that ‘I never can hope to see the like done again by man
or woman.’ Also in the character of a mad girl and a young
gallant, both admirable. But when she attempted such a part
as the Emperor’s daughter, good Samuel confesses she does it
‘most basely.’ Burnet designates her as the ‘indiscreetest and
wildest creature that ever was in a court.’ Charles gave her a
house in Pall Mall, in which we are told there was one room
on the ground-floor of which the walls and ceiling were
entirely composed of looking-glass. An anecdote is given of
her, that, on one occasion when driving in a superb coach up
Ludgate Hill, she met some bailiffs hurrying a clergyman to
prison for debt. Inquiring as to the sum, she paid it on the
spot, and later on procured preferment for him. Her son,
afterwards Duke of St. Albans, was born in 1670 before she
left the stage.</p>

<p class='c016'>Dryden was a great admirer of pretty Nell, and wrote a
prologue for her, which she spoke under a hat of such
enormous dimensions as almost to conceal her small figure.
The audience were convulsed with laughter, and Charles
was almost suffocated.</p>

<p class='c016'>Nell called his Majesty <i>her</i> Charles the Third, as she had
had two protectors before who were his namesakes. Although
thoughtless and reckless, she was a good friend to Charles
in some respects, urging him constantly to pay more attention
to public affairs, and interceding with him for objects of
charity; she took a great interest in the foundation of Chelsea
Hospital, and persuaded the King to hasten its completion.
‘How am I to please my people?’ he asked of her one day.
‘There is but one way,’ she replied: ‘dismiss your ladies
and attend to your business:’ neither of which injunctions
<span class='pageno' id='Page_252'>252</span>was obeyed. Nell Gwynne died at her house in Pall Mall in
1691, having survived the King some years, who, it will be remembered,
in his last moments recommended her to the care
of those who stood beside his bed. Dr. Tenison, afterwards
Archbishop of Canterbury, preached her funeral sermon at the
church of St. Martin’s in the Fields, where she lies buried.
There is little doubt she died a penitent.</p>

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work (any work
on which the phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; appears, or with which the
phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions

    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg&#8482;
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg&#8482; License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
